`2. They ought to draw daily from the word of God and especially from the sacraments, to receive the power for their spiritual lives and strength for apostolic labor:
1` alert to the word of God, in constant meditation, and according to the example of the fathers of the faith, students are to train for a life more configured to the life of Christ, and, strengthened in faith, hope and charity, to strive to live according to the pattern given in the Gospel;

Canon349 = '''
Canon 349: `1.

`2. Both historical and systematic courses are to be taught so that students can easily discern truth and falsehood with a sharp intellectual discretion, can properly pursue theological investigations with a mind open to the word of God, and be made more suitable for carrying out the ministry by a dialogue with the learned people of this age.
'''
Canon350 = '''
Canon 350: `1. Theological disciplines are to be so taught in the light of faith in such a way that students deeply penetrate Catholic doctrine drawn from divine revelation and express it in their own culture so that it may be nourishment for their own spiritual life and an instrument for usefully carrying out effective ministry.
`2. It is necessary that Sacred Scripture be as the soul of all of theology, and must influence all sacred disciplines; therefore in addition to exegesis, an accurate methodology, the principal sources of the economy of salvation as well as the greater themes of biblical theology are to be taught.
`3. Liturgy is to be taught in virtue of its special importance as a necessary source of doctrine and of a truly Christian spirit.

`3. Although students are preparing themselves for the ministry in their own Church sui iuris, they are to be formed in a truly universal spirit by which they are prepared in spirit to respond in the service of souls everywhere in the world. Therefore they are to be thoroughly instructed about the needs of the universal Church, and especially about the apostolate of ecumenism and evangelization.

`3. Likewise Catholic ministers licitly administer the sacraments of penance, the Eucharist and anointing of the sick to Christian faithful of Eastern Churches, who do not have full communion with the Catholic Church, if they ask for them on their own and are properly disposed.

`2. The first recourse against decrees of the protosyncellus or the syncelli is made to the eparchial bishop; against those who act by delegated power, recourse is made to the one who gave the delegation.
'''
Canon998 = '''
Canon 998: `1. It is very desirable that whenever someone feels injured by a decree, there not be a dispute between this person and the author of the decree but that they seek to find an equitable solution between them, perhaps through the use of wise persons in mediation or study so that through a voluntary emendation of the decree or through just compensation or by some other suitable means the controversy may be avoided.
`2. The superior authority should encourage the parties to do this before he receives the appeal.
'''
Canon999 = '''
Canon 999: `1. Before proposing some recourse, a person must seek the revocation or emendation of the decree in writing from its author within a peremptory period of ten days from legal notice of the decree; when such a petition is proposed it is understood by the law itself that the suspension of the execution of the decree is also being petitioned.
`2. The obligation of petitioning the revocation or emendation of a decree does not bind if it concerns the first recourse against a decree mentioned in can. 997, `2, or if it concerns further recourse except for recourse against decrees of the eparchial bishop, by which a first recourse has been decided.
'''
Canon1000 = '''
Canon 1000: `1. In cases in which recourse suspends the execution of the decree, the petition also has the same effect as that mentioned in can. 999, `1.
`2. In other cases, unless within ten days from the receipt of the petition, the author of the decree suspends its execution, a suspension can meanwhile be petitioned from his superior authority who can decide it only for grave reasons and always cautiously lest the salvation of souls be injured in some way; if recourse is proposed later, the authority who must deal with the recourse is to determine whether the suspension is to be confirmed or revoked.
`3. If no recourse is proposed against the decree within the stated period or if recourse is sought only for the reparation of damages, the suspension of the execution ceases by the law itself.
'''
Canon1001 = '''
Canon 1001: `1. Recourse must be proposed within a peremptory period of fifteen days.
`2. The period of fifteen days runs:
1` in a case in which the petition of revocation or emendation of the decree is permitted, from the day the decree is made known the party by which the author amended the prior decree or rejected the petition, or, if he decrees nothing, from the thirtieth day from the receipt of the petition;
2` in other cases, from the day on which the decree is made known to the party.
'''
Canon1002 = '''
Canon 1002: The superior authority must issue a decree by which the recourse is decided within sixty days of receipt of the recourse unless the particular law of the proper Church sui iuris states otherwise; if it is not done and the person making recourse petitions in writing that the decree be made, from the thirtieth day after receipt of the petition, if still nothing is done, the recourse is considered rejected as if it was rejected on that day by a decree, and a new recourse can be proposed against him.

'''
Canon1004 = '''
Canon 1004: The superior authority who examines the recourse, is able not only to confirm or declare the decree null, but also to rescind or revoke it, but the superior authority cannot amend it unless by the particular law of the Church sui iuris this power is also accorded to the superior authority.
'''
Canon1005 = '''
Canon 1005: Even if a decree from a superior authority is confirmed, declared null, rescinded, revoked, or amended, in regard to the reparation of damages, if perhaps they are owed, the one who gave the first decree should respond; the superior authority should respond only to the extent of the damages which arose from its decree.
'''
Canon1006 = '''
Canon 1006: Even if it is a case of decrees which concern the eparchy of the patriarch or a decree by which the patriarch has decided recourse, recourse against administrative decrees of patriarchs is made to a special group of bishops constituted according to the norm of particular law, unless the question is deferred to the Apostolic See; against the decision of this group one is not given further recourse except by appeal to the Roman Pontiff himself.

`4. The group of eparchial bishops who consented to having such a tribunal, or an eparchial bishop elected by them, has all the powers which an eparchial bishop has over his own tribunal; if, however, the tribunal was established by the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or by the Apostolic See, the norms determined by the synod or by the Apostolic See are to be observed.

`2. To prevent the extinction of a right, however, the judge can admit a procurator without the presentation of the mandate provided that some suitable security is furnished if necessary; the judicial acts, however, lack all force unless the procurator presents a mandate within the peremptory time limits set by the judge.
'''
Canon1143 = '''

`3. If it is evident that the arbitration sentence is null because matters prescribed for validity in the compromise document were neglected, the judicial vicar is to declare the nullity and to notify the parties of it as soon as possible; there is no recourse against this declaration.

#Chapter I.  The Ordinary Contentious Trial
#Art. I.  The Introductory Libellus of Litigation
Canon1185 = '''
Canon 1185: A person who wishes to bring another to court must present a introductory libellus to a competent judge, which explains the object of the controversy and requests the services of the judge.
'''
Canon1186 = '''
Canon 1186: `1. The judge may accept an oral petition if either the petitioner is impeded from presenting a introductory libellus or the case can be easily investigated and is of lesser importance.
`2. But in either situation the judge is to require the notary to put the act into writing, which is to be read to and approved by the petitioner; this then takes the place of and has all the legal effects of a introductory libellus written by the petitioner.
'''
Canon1187 = '''
Canon 1187: A libellus which introduces a suit must:
1` express before which judge the case is being introduced, what is being petitioned and by whom the petition is being made;
2` indicate the basis for the petitioner's right and at least in general the facts and proofs which will be used to prove what has been alleged;
3` be signed by the petitioner or procurator, adding the day, month and year, as well as the address of the petitioner or procurator or the place where they say they reside for the purpose of receiving the acts;
4` indicate the domicile or quasi-domicile of the respondent.
'''
Canon1188 = '''
Canon 1188: `1. After the single judge or the president of a collegiate tribunal has recognized both that the matter is within his competence and that the petitioner does not lack legitimate personal standing in court, he must accept or reject the introductory libellus as soon as possible through a decree.
`2. A libellus introducing a suit can be rejected only if:
1` the judge or the tribunal is incompetent;
2` it is undoubtedly clear that the petitioner lacks legitimate personal standing in court;
3` the prescriptions of can. 1187, nn. 1-3 have not been observed;
4` from the introductory libellus itself it is certainly obvious that it lacks any basis whatsoever and that it is impossible that any such basis would appear through a process.
`3. If the introductory libellus has been rejected due to defects which can be corrected, the petitioner can properly draw up a new libellus and again present it to the same judge.
`4. A party is always free within ten available days (tempus utile) to lodge a reasoned recourse against the rejection of the introductory libellus before the appellate tribunal or the college if it had been rejected by its president; the question of the rejection is to be resolved most expeditiously.
'''
Canon1189 = '''
Canon 1189: If within a month from the presentation of the libellus the judge has not issued a decree by which he accepts or rejects the libellus the interested party can insist that the judge fulfill his duty; but if the judge, nevertheless, remains silent for ten days after the petitioner's insistence, the petition is considered as having been accepted.

#Art. II.  The Citation and Intimation or Notification of Judicial Acts
Canon1190 = '''
Canon 1190: `1. In the decree which accepts the introductory libellus of the petitioner the judge or president must either call into court or cite the other parties for the joinder of issues (contestatio litis), determining whether they must respond in writing or present themselves personally before the judge in order to join the issues. But if from the written responses the judge perceives that it is necessary to call the parties together for a session, that can be determined in a new decree.
`2. If the introductory libellus is considered as having been accepted in virtue of the norm of can. 1189, the decree of citation must be made in court within twenty days from the party's insistence on action as mentioned in that canon.
`3. But if the litigating parties de facto present themselves before the judge in order to proceed with the case, there is no need for a citation; the notary, however, is to note in the acts that the parties were present for the trial.
'''
Canon1191 = '''
Canon 1191: `1. The decree of citation to the trial must be forwarded immediately to the respondent and at the same time to others who are to appear.
`2. The introductory libellus is to be joined to the citation unless for serious reasons the judge determines that the libellus is not to be made known to the respondent before the latter makes a deposition during the trial.
`3. If the suit is filed against a person who does not have the free exercise of personal rights or the free administration of the controverted items, the citation is to be made known to the guardian, curator or special procurator, as the case may be, or to the person who is bound to enter the trial in the respondent's name according to the norm of law.
'''
Canon1192 = '''
Canon 1192: `1. Notification of citations, decrees, sentences and other judicial acts are to be made through the public postal services, with an acknowledgement of receipt card, or through another method which is the safest, observing particular law.

`3. A respondent who refuses to accept the document of citation or who prevents its arrival is considered as having been legitimately cited.

Canon1193 = '''
Canon 1193: If the citation is not legitimately communicated, the acts of the process are null, unless the party nevertheless appeared to pursue the case.

`3. The formulation of the doubt not only is to ask whether there is proof of nullity of marriage in the case, but it also must determine on what ground or grounds the validity of the marriage is to be challenged.
`4. Ten days after the communication of the decree, the presiding judge or the ponens is to arrange for the instruction of the case by a new decree if the parties were not opposed.
'''
#4` Proofs
Canon1364 = '''
Canon 1364: `1. The defender of the bond, the advocates of the parties and the promoter of justice, if intervening in the suit, have the right:
1` to be present at the examination of the parties, the witnesses and the experts, with due regard for the prescription of can. 1240;
2` to inspect the judicial acts even though not published and to review the documents produced by the parties.
`2. The parties cannot assist at the examination mentioned in 1, n. 1.
'''
Canon1365 = '''
Canon 1365: Unless full proofs are present from other sources, in evaluating the deposition of the parties in accordance with can. 1217, `2, the judge is to use witnesses regarding the credibility of the parties, if possible, as well as other indications and aids.

Canon 1366: In cases of impotence or defect of consent due to mental illness, the judge is to use the services of one or more experts unless it is obvious from the circumstances that this would be useless; in other cases the prescription of can. 1255 is to be observed.
'''
Canon1367 = '''
Canon 1367: During the instruction of a case, whenever a very probable doubt emerges that the marriage was not consummated, after suspending the nullity case with the consent of the parties, the tribunal can complete the instruction of the case for a dissolution of a non-consummated sacramental marriage; the acts are to be sent to the Apostolic See together with a petition for this dissolution from either or both spouses and with the votum of the tribunal and the eparchial bishop.
'''
#5` The Sentence and the Appeal
Canon1368 = '''
Canon 1368: `1. The sentence which first declared the nullity of the marriage together with the appeals if there are any and the other acts of the trial, are to be sent ex officio to the appellate tribunal within twenty days from the communication of the sentence.
`2. If the sentence rendered in favor of the nullity of marriage was in the first grade of trial, the appellate tribunal by its own decree is to confirm the decision without delay or admit the case to an ordinary examination of a new grade of trial, after considering the observations of the defender of the bond and those of the parties if there are any.
'''
Canon1369 = '''
Canon 1369: If at the appellate level a new ground of nullity of the marriage is offered, the tribunal can admit it and judge it as if in first instance.
'''
Canon1370 = '''
Canon 1370: `1. After the sentence which first declared the nullity of marriage has been confirmed at the appellate level either by decree or by another sentence, those persons whose marriage was declared null can contract new marriages immediately after the decree or the second sentence has been made known to them unless a prohibition is attached to his sentence or decree, or it is prohibited by a determination of the local hierarch.
`2. The prescriptions of can. 1325 must be observed, even if the sentence which declared the nullity of marriage was not confirmed by another sentence but by a decree.
'''
Canon1371 = '''
Canon 1371: Immediately after the sentence has been executed, the judicial vicar must notify the hierarch of the place in which the marriage was celebrated about this. That hierarch must take care that notation be made quickly in the matrimonial and baptismal registers concerning the nullity of the marriage and any prohibitions which may have been determined.
'''
#6` The Documentary Process
Canon1372 = '''
Canon 1372: `1. After a petition has been admitted, the judicial vicar or a judge designated by him, omitting the formalities of the ordinary process but having cited the parties and with the intervention of the defender of the bond, can declare the nullity of a marriage by a sentence, if from a document which is subject to no contradiction or exception there is certain proof of the existence of a diriment impediment or a defect of the form for the celebration of marriage required by law, provided that it is clear with equal certitude that a dispensation was not granted; this can also be done if there is certain proof of the defect of a valid mandate of procurator.
`2. However if it is the case of one who would have been obliged to observe the prescribed form for the celebration of marriage required by law, but who attempted marriage before a civil official or a non-Catholic minister, the pre-nuptial investigation mentioned in can. 784 suffices to prove his or her free status.
'''
Canon1373 = '''
Canon 1373: `1. If the defender of the bond prudently thinks that either the flaws mentioned in can. 1372, `1 or the lack of a dispensation are not certain, the defender of the bond must appeal against this declaration to the judge of second instance, to whom the acts must be sent and who must be advised in writing that it is a question of a documentary process.
`2. The party who feels aggrieved retains the right to appeal.
'''
Canon1374 = '''
Canon 1374: The judge in second instance, with the intervention of the defender of the bond, having heard the parties, shall decree whether the sentence is to be confirmed or whether the case must rather be handled according to the ordinary process of law; and in that case the judge remands it to the tribunal of first instance.

Canon1378 = '''
Canon 1378: `1. Personal separation of spouses, unless otherwise legally provided for in particular places, can be decided by a decree of a eparchial bishop, or by a sentence of a judge.
`2. Where an ecclesiastical decision has no civil effects, or if it is foreseen that a civil sentence is not contrary to divine law, the eparchial bishop of the eparchy of residence of the spouses can give them permission to approach the civil forum, having considered the particular circumstances.
`3. Also, if a case is concerned only with the merely civil effects of marriage, the judge can determine if is sufficient, with the permission of the eparchial bishop, that the case be deferred to the civil forum from the start.
'''
Canon1379 = '''
Canon 1379: `1. Unless one party seeks an ordinary contentious process, a summary contentious process is to be used.

#Art. III.  Process in the Presumed Death of a Spouse
Canon1383 = '''
Canon 1383: `1. Whenever the death of a spouse cannot be proven by an authentic ecclesiastical or civil document, the other spouse is not considered free from the bond of marriage until after a declaration of presumed death is made by the eparchial bishop.
`2. The eparchial bishop can make this declaration only after appropriate investigation has enabled him to attain moral certitude of the death of a spouse from the depositions of witnesses, from rumor, or from indications. The mere absence of a spouse, even for a long time, is insufficient.
`3. In uncertain and complex cases, an eparchial bishop exercising his power within the territorial boundaries of a patriarchal Church shall consult the patriarch; other eparchial bishops shall consult the Apostolic See.
`4. In such a procedure the intervention of the promoter of justice is required, but not of the defender of the bond.

`2. If the dicastery remands the case to a tribunal, the canons on trials in general and on the ordinary contentious trial are to be observed unless the nature of the matter precludes this; the canons on the summary contentious process cannot, however, be used.
`3. Once the libellus is sent, the cleric is forbidden to exercise orders by the law itself.
'''
Canon1387 = '''
Canon 1387: After the second sentence which has confirmed the nullity of sacred ordination the cleric loses all rights proper to the clerical state and is free of all obligations.

#Chapter III.  The Procedure in the Removal or Transfer of Pastors
Canon1388 = '''
Canon 1388: In the removal or transfer of pastors, cann. 1389-1400 are to be observed unless something else is established by particular law approved by the Apostolic See.
'''
#Art. I.  The Manner of Proceeding in Removing Pastors
Canon1389 = '''
Canon 1389: When the ministry of any pastor has become detrimental or at least ineffective for any reason, even through no grave fault of his own, he can be removed from the parish by the eparchial bishop.
'''
Canon1390 = '''
Canon 1390: The reasons for which a pastor can be legitimately removed from his parish are especially the following:
1` a way of acting which is gravely detrimental or disturbing to ecclesiastical communion;
2` incompetence or a permanent infirmity of mind or body which renders a pastor incapable of performing his functions in a useful way;
3` loss of good reputation among upright and good parishioners or aversion to the pastor which are foreseen as not ceasing in a short time;
4` grave neglect or violation of parochial duties which persist after a warning;
5` poor administration of temporal affairs with grave damage to the Church whenever this problem cannot be remedied in any other way.
'''
Canon1391 = '''
Canon 1391: `1. If after an inquiry has been conducted, it is proven that a reason is present, the eparchial bishop is to discuss the matter with two pastors from the group of pastors permanently selected for this by the presbyteral council after their being proposed by the eparchial bishop; but if subsequently he decides that the removal must take place, he is paternally to persuade the pastor to resign the pastorate within a period of fifteen days, after he has explained, for validity, the reason and the arguments for removal.
`2. The pastor who is a member of a religious institute or a society of common life in the manner of religious can be removed either at the discretion of the eparchial bishop after having notified the major superior or by the major superior who has notified the eparchial bishop, without the need of each other's consent.
'''
Canon1392 = '''
Canon 1392: A resignation by a pastor can be submitted conditionally provided that this can be legitimately accepted by the eparchial bishop and is actually accepted.
'''
Canon1393 = '''
Canon 1393: `1. If the pastor has not answered within the prescribed time period the eparchial bishop is to repeat the invitation extending the available time for response.
`2. If the bishop has the proof that the pastor has received the second invitation but has not responded although not hindered by any impediment or if the pastor refuses to resign giving no reasons, the eparchial bishop is to issue the decree of removal.
'''
Canon1394 = '''
Canon 1394: But if the pastor opposes the cause alleged for removal and its reasons, alleging reasons which appear insufficient to the eparchial bishop, in order for the latter to act validly, he is to:
1` invite the pastor to organize his challenges to removal in a written report, having inspected the acts, and also to offer proofs to the contrary, if he has any;
2` consider the matter with the same pastors mentioned in can. 1391, `1 unless others must be designated due to their inability, after he has completed the instruction if necessary;
3` finally determine whether or not the pastor must be removed and promptly issue a decree on the matter.
'''
Canon1395 = '''
Canon 1395: When the pastor has been removed, the eparchial bishop is to provide for him through an assignment to another office, if he is suitable for this, or through a pension, as the case requires and circumstances permit.
'''
Canon1396 = '''
Canon 1396: `1. The removed pastor must abstain from exercising the office of pastor, vacate the rectory immediately, and hand over all that pertains to the parish to the one to whom the bishop entrusts the parish.
`2. If there is question of a sick pastor who cannot be transferred elsewhere from the rectory without inconvenience, the eparchial bishop is to leave the rectory even to his exclusive use while this need lasts.
`3. While recourse is pending against the decree of removal, the bishop cannot name a new pastor but meanwhile is to provide a parish administrator.
'''
#Art. II.  The Manner of Proceeding in the Transfer of Pastors
Canon1397 = '''
Canon 1397: If the good of souls or the need or advantage of the Church requires that a pastor be transferred from his parish which he is governing usefully to another parish or to another office, the eparchial bishop is to propose the transfer to him in writing and persuade him to consent to it for the love of God and of souls.
'''
Canon1398 = '''
Canon 1398: If the pastor does not intend to yield to the counsel and persuasion of the eparchial bishop, he is to explain his reasons in writing.
'''
Canon1399 = '''
Canon 1399: `1. Notwithstanding the reasons alleged, if the eparchial bishop judges that he is not going to change his plans, he is to discuss the reasons which favor or oppose the transfer with the two pastors chosen in accordance with can. 1391, `1; if he then decides to implement the transfer, he is to repeat the paternal exhortations to the pastor.
`2. When this has been done, if the pastor still refuses and the eparchial bishop thinks the transfer must be made, he is to issue a decree of transfer stating that the parish shall be vacant after the lapse of a predetermined time.
`3. If this period of time has passed in vain, the eparchial bishop is to declare the parish vacant.
'''
Canon1400 = '''
Canon 1400: In cases of transfer, the prescriptions of can. 1396, are to be observed with due regard to rights and equity.
'''
#TITLE XXVII.  PENAL SANCTIONS IN THE CHURCH
#Chapter I.  Delicts and Penalties in General
Canon1401 = '''
Canon 1401: Since God employs every means to bring back the erring sheep, those who have received from Him the power of loosing and binding, are to treat appropriately the illness of those who have committed offenses, by correcting, reproving, appealing, constantly teaching and never losing patience, and are even to impose penalties in order to ensure that the wounds inflicted by the offense may receive a cure and to preclude the offender from being given to dissoluteness of life and contempt of the law.
'''
Canon1402 = '''
Canon 1402: `1. Every contrary custom being reprobated, a canonical penalty must be imposed through a penal trial prescribed in cann. 1468-1482, without prejudice to the coercive power of the judge in the instances mentioned expressly in the law.
`2. If, however, in the judgment of the authority spoken of in 3, there are weighty reasons precluding a penal trial, and the proofs of the offense are certain, the offense can be punished by an extra-judicial decree in accordance with cann. 1486 and 1487, as long as it is not a case of a deprivation of office, title, insignia or a suspension for more than one year, demotion to a lower grade, deposition or major excommunication.
`3. Besides the Apostolic See, such a decree can be issued, within the limits of their competence, by the patriarch, major archbishop, eparchial bishop and the major superior of an institute of consecrated life who enjoys ordinary governing power, all others being excluded.
'''
Canon1403 = '''
Canon 1403: `1. Even when it is a case of offenses which carry by law an obligatory penalty, the hierarch can abstain from a penal process, and even abstain totally from imposing penalties, after having heard the promoter of justice, as long as in the judgment of the hierarch the following conditions simultaneously concur: the offender, who has not yet been brought to trial, moved by sincere repentance, has confessed his offense to the hierarch in the external forum, and adequate provision has been made to repair the scandal and the harm.
`2. However, the hierarch cannot do this when it is an offense which carries a penalty whose remission is reserved to a higher authority, until he has received permission from the same authority.
'''
Canon1404 = '''
Canon 1404: `1. In the matter of penalties, the more benign interpretation is to be followed.
`2. It is not permitted to extend a penalty from one person to another, or from one case to another, although the reasoning may be the same, or even weightier.
'''
Canon1405 = '''
Canon 1405: `1. Whoever has legislative power can also issue penal laws insofar as they are truly necessary to provide more aptly for ecclesiastical discipline; he can also by his own laws strengthen with a suitable penalty divine law or ecclesiastical law enacted by higher authority, observing the territorial and personal limitations of his competence.
`2. Particular law may add additional penalties to the penalties established in common law for a certain offense, but this shall not be done except for a very serious reason. If, however, common law has established an indeterminate or facultative penalty, particular law can establish in its place a determinate or obligatory penalty.
`3. Patriarchs and eparchial bishops shall take care that particular penal laws be uniform in the same territory, to the extent that this is possible.
'''
Canon1406 = '''
Canon 1406: `1. To the extent that someone can impose precepts, he can, after mature reflection and with utmost moderation, threaten by precept determinate penalties, with the exception of those enumerated in can. 1402, `2. The patriarch, however, can threaten even these penalties by precept with the consent of the permanent synod.
`2. A warning containing the threat of penalties by which the hierarch sanctions a non-penal law in individual cases, is equivalent to a penal precept.
'''
Canon1407 = '''
Canon 1407: `1. If, in the judgment of the hierarch who can inflict a penalty, the nature of the offense permits it, the penalty cannot be imposed unless the offender has been warned at least once in advance to desist from the offense, with adequate time given for reconsideration.
`2. One is to be said to have desisted from the offense who has sincerely repented the misdeed, and has in addition given adequate reparation of the scandal and of the harm, or has at least seriously promised to do it.
`3. The penal warning mentioned in can. 1406, `2 suffices for the imposition of the penalty.
'''
Canon1408 = '''
Canon 1408: A penalty does not bind the guilty party before it has been imposed by a sentence or decree, without prejudice to the right of the Roman Pontiff or an Ecumenical Council to determine otherwise.
'''
Canon1409 = '''
Canon 1409: `1. In the application of penal law, even when the law is expressed in preceptive terms, the judge, in accord with his own conscience and prudence, can:
1` defer the imposition of the penalty to a more appropriate time, if it is foreseen that greater harm will ensue from a hasty punishment of the guilty party;
2` abstain from imposing a penalty or impose a lighter penalty if the offender has reformed and reparation of the scandal and harm has been adequately provided, or if the guilty party has been, or it is foreseen, will be sufficiently punished by civil authority;
3` moderate the penalties within equitable limits if the guilty party committed several offenses, and the cumulative burden of the penalties appears excessive;
4` suspend the obligation of observing the penalty in favor of him who has committed an offense for the first time, after having been commended heretofore by an upright life, as long as the need to repair scandal is not pressing. The suspended penalty is lifted entirely if the guilty party has not repeated the offense within the time set by the judge; otherwise such a one shall be more severely punished as the perpetrator of both offenses, unless in the meantime time has run out for initiating a penal action for the prior offense.
`2. If the penalty is indeterminate and the law does not provide otherwise, the judge cannot impose the penalties mentioned in can. 1402, `2.
'''
Canon1410 = '''
Canon 1410: The imposition of penalties on a cleric must preserve for him what is necessary for his decent support, unless it is a case of deposition, in which event the hierarch is to see to it that the deposed who is truly in need because of the punishment is provided for in the best way possible, taking into account always his vested right to insurance and social security as well as health insurance for him and for his family, if he is married.
'''
Canon1411 = '''
Canon 1411: No penalty can be imposed after the time for a penal action has been extinguished.
'''
Canon1412 = '''
Canon 1412: `1. One who is bound by the law or a precept is also subject to the penalty attached to it.
`2. If the law is changed after the offense was committed, the law more favorable to the accused is to be applied.
`3. If the subsequent law abolishes the law or at least the penalty, it ceases at once irrespective of the manner in which it had been imposed.
`4. The penalty binds the guilty party everywhere even after the authority of the one who has imposed the penalty has lapsed, unless it is expressly provided otherwise in common law.
'''
Canon1413 = '''
Canon 1413: `1. One who has not completed the fourteenth year of age is not subject to any penalty.
`2. Those, however, who have committed an offense between their fourteenth and eighteenth year of age can be punished only with penalties which do not include the loss of some good, unless the eparchial bishop or the judge decides in special cases that their reformation can be better provided for otherwise.
'''
Canon1414 = '''
Canon 1414: `1. Only those are subject to penalties who have violated a penal law or a penal precept, either by deliberate action or by seriously culpable omission of due diligence, or by seriously culpable ignorance of the law or precept.
`2. Once the external violation of a penal law or penal precept has occurred, it is presumed that it was a deliberate act, until the contrary is proven. In respect to other laws or precepts this is presumed only if the law or precept is violated again after a penal warning.
'''
Canon1415 = '''
Canon 1415: If in accordance with common practice and canonical doctrine there is present an extenuating circumstance, the judge must mitigate the penalty established in law or precept, as long as there is still an offense. Guided by his prudence, he can also abstain from imposing a penalty if he judges that one can better achieve by other means the reformation of the offender and the reparation of the harm and scandal.
'''
Canon1416 = '''
Canon 1416: When an offense was committed by a recidivist, or if according to common practice and canonical doctrine there is another aggravating circumstance, the judge can punish the offender more severely than foreseen in the law or precept, not excluding the penalties mentioned in can. 1402, `2.
'''
Canon1417 = '''
Canon 1417: When persons conspire together to commit an offense, and accomplices are not expressly mentioned in the law or precept, they can be punished with the same penalties as the principal offender, or, according to the prudence of the judge, by other penalties of the same or lesser gravity.
'''
Canon1418 = '''
Canon 1418: `1. One who in order to commit an offense did something, or failed to do something, but then nevertheless, despite his intention, did not complete the offense, is not held by the penalty established for the consummated offense, unless the law or the precept provides otherwise.
`2. If, however, the actions or omissions by their nature lead to the execution of the offense, the perpetrator is to be punished by an appropriate penalty, especially if it resulted in scandal or other serious harm. Nevertheless, the penalty is to be more lenient than the one prescribed for a completed offense.
`3. One who spontaneously has desisted from the execution of an initiated offense is free of any penalty if no harm or scandal ensued from the attempt.
'''
Canon1419 = '''
Canon 1419: `1. One who can dispense from a penal law or can exempt someone from a penal precept, can also remit the penalty imposed in virtue of the same law or precept.
`2. In addition, the power of remitting penalties can also be granted to others by the law or penal precept.
'''
Canon1420 = '''
Canon 1420: `1. A penalty imposed in virtue of common law can be remitted by:
1` the hierarch who has initiated the penal trial or has imposed the penalty by decree;
2` the hierarch of the place where the guilty party lives, but after consultation with the hierarch mentioned in n. 1.
`2. These norms apply also in respect to penalties imposed in virtue of particular law or a penal precept, unless the particular law of a Church sui iuris provides otherwise.
`3. A penalty, however, imposed by the Apostolic See can be remitted only by the Apostolic See, unless the remitting of the penalty is delegated to the patriarch or to others.
'''
Canon1421 = '''
Canon 1421: The remitting of a penalty extorted by force, grave fear or fraud is null by the law itself.
'''
Canon1422 = '''
Canon 1422: `1. A penalty can be remitted even if the matter is unknown, or even under a condition.
`2. The remission must be given in writing unless a serious reason suggests otherwise.
`3. Care shall be taken that the petition for remission of the penalty or the remission itself not be made public, unless this is either useful for protecting the good name of the offender or necessary for repairing the scandal.
'''
Canon1423 = '''
Canon 1423: `1. Without prejudice to the right of the Roman Pontiff to reserve to himself or others the remitting of any penalty, the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or major archiepiscopal Churches can for serious reasons by the enactment of a law reserve the remitting of penalties to the patriarch or major archbishop, in respect of their subjects who have a domicile or quasi-domicile within the territorial boundaries of the Church over which they preside. Nobody else can validly reserve to himself or to others the penalties established in common law except with the consent of the Apostolic See.
`2. Every reservation is to be interpreted strictly.
'''
Canon1424 = '''
Canon 1424: `1. The remission of a penalty cannot be granted unless the guilty party has sincerely repented, and, moreover, suitable provisions have been made to repair the scandal and harm.
`2. If, however, in the judgment of him who is competent to remit the penalty, these conditions have been fulfilled the remission is not to be denied, insofar as this is possible considering the nature of the penalty.
'''
Canon1425 = '''
Canon 1425: If someone is bound by several penalties, the remission is valid only in respect to penalties expressly mentioned in it; but a general remission removes all penalties except those which the guilty party in bad faith has concealed in the petition.

Canon1426 = '''
Canon 1426: `1. Unless another penalty is provided in the law, according to the ancient traditions of the Eastern Churches, penalties can be imposed which require some serious work of religion or piety or charity, such as certain prayers, a pious pilgrimage, a special fast, alms, spiritual retreats.
`2. Other penalties are to be imposed on one who is not disposed to accept these penalties.
'''
Canon1427 = '''
Canon 1427: `1. Without prejudice to particular law, a public reprimand is to be administered either before a notary or two witnesses or by letter, but in such a way that the reception and the contents of the letter are provable through some document.
`2. Care shall be taken that the public reprimand does not result in a greater than appropriate disgrace of the guilty party.
'''
Canon1428 = '''
Canon 1428: If the seriousness of the case demands it and especially if it concerns recidivists, the hierarch can, in addition to the penalties imposed by a sentence according to the law, submit the offender to vigilance in the manner determined by an administrative decree.
'''
Canon1429 = '''
Canon 1429: `1. The prohibition against living in a certain place or territory can affect only clerics and religious or members of a society of common life in the manner of religious, an injunction to live in a certain place or territory affects only clerics enrolled in an eparchy, without prejudice to institutes of consecrated life.
`2. For the imposition of the injunction to live in a certain place or territory, the consent of the hierarch of that place is required, unless it is a case either of a house of an institute of consecrated life of papal or patriarchal right, in which case the consent of the competent superior is required, or of a house designated for the correction and reformation of clerics of several eparchies.

Canon1430 = '''
Canon 1430: `1. Penal deprivations can affect only those powers, offices, ministries, functions, rights, privileges, faculties, benefits, titles, insignia, which are subject to the power of the authority that establishes the penalty, or of the hierarch who initiated the penal trial or imposed it by decree; the same applies to penal transfer to another office.
`2. Deprivation of the power of sacred orders is not possible, but only a prohibition against exercising all or some acts of orders, in accordance with common law; nor is deprivation of academic degrees possible.

'''
Canon1432 = '''
Canon 1432: `1. A suspension can refer to all or some acts of the power of orders or of governance, to all or some acts or rights connected with an office, ministry or function; the extension of the suspension is to be defined in the sentence or decree itself, unless it is already determined in the law.
`2. Nobody can be suspended except from acts which are subject to the power of the authority that imposes the penalty or of the hierarch who initiated the penal process or inflicts the suspension by a decree.
`3. A suspension never affects the validity of acts nor the right to a dwelling place which the offender may have by reason of an office, ministry or function. A suspension forbidding, however, the reception of revenues, remuneration, pensions, or anything else, carries with it the obligation of restoring whatever was illegitimately received even in good faith.

#Art. I.  The Preliminary Investigation
Canon1468 = '''
Canon 1468: `1. Whenever the hierarch has knowledge, which at least seems true, of a delict, he is carefully to inquire personally or through another suitable person about the facts and circumstances unless such an investigation seems entirely superfluous.
`2. Care must be taken lest anyone's good name be endangered by this investigation.
`3. The one who conducts the investigation has the same powers and obligations as an auditor in the process; this person cannot act as a judge in the matter, if a penal trial is initiated later.
'''
Canon1469 = '''
Canon 1469: `1. With due regard for cann. 1403 and 1411, if the investigation seems sufficiently instructed, the hierarch is to decide whether a procedure for imposing penalties is to be initiated and, if he decides affirmatively, whether it is to be dealt with by way of a penal trial or extra-judicial decree.
`2. The hierarch is to revoke or change his decision whenever it seems to him from new evidence and circumstances, that another decision is necessary.
`3. Before making any decision in the matter, the hierarch is to hear the accused and the promoter of justice regarding the delict as well as, if he considers it prudent, two judges or others expert of the law. The hierarch is also to examine carefully whether, in order to avoid useless trials, it is expedient for him or the investigator, with the consent of the parties, to resolve equitably the question of damages.
'''
Canon1470 = '''
Canon 1470: The acts of the investigation, the decrees of the hierarch by which the investigation is opened and closed, and all that precedes it are to be kept in the secret archive of the curia if they are not necessary for the procedure for imposing penalties.

Canon1471 = '''
Canon 1471: `1. With due regard for the canons of this title, unless otherwise indicated by the nature of the matter, the canons on trials in general and on the ordinary contentious trial are to be applied to the penal trial as well as the special norms on cases which involve the public good, not, however, the canons on the summary contentious trial.
`2. The accused is not bound to confess the offense and cannot be asked to take an oath.
'''
Canon1472 = '''
Canon 1472: `1. If the hierarch has decreed that a penal trial is to be begun, he is to hand over the acts of the investigation to the promoter of justice who is to present a libellus of accusation to the judge according to the norms of cann. 1185 and 1187.
`2. The promoter of justice constituted as such by the higher tribunal acts as the petitioner before that tribunal.
'''
Canon1473 = '''
Canon 1473: To prevent scandal, to protect the freedom of witnesses and to safeguard the course of justice, the hierarch can, at any stage and grade of the trial, after hearing the promoter of justice and after citing the accused, prevent the accused from the exercise of sacred orders, an office, ministry or another function, can impose or prohibit residence in some place or territory, or can even prohibit the public reception of the Divine Eucharist. When the reason for all these measures ceases, they must be revoked and they also cease by the law itself when the penal trial ends.
'''
Canon1474 = '''
Canon 1474: The judge must invite the accused, when cited, to appoint an advocate within a defined time period; if it elapses without result, the same judge is to appoint ex officio for the accused, an advocate, who shall remain in office until the accused has appointed an advocate.

Canon 1475: `1. In any grade of the trial, renunciation of the instance can be made by the promoter of justice either at the order of or with the consent of the hierarch in light of whose deliberation the trial was set in motion.

Canon1479 = '''
Canon 1479: `1. When the discussion has been completed, the tribunal is to render a sentence.

Canon1480 = '''
Canon 1480: The dispositive part of the sentence is to be published immediately unless the tribunal for a serious cause decides that the decision is to be kept secret until the formal publication of the sentence, which can never be deferred beyond a month from the day when the penal case was decided.
'''
Canon1481 = '''
Canon 1481: `1. The offender can propose an appeal even if the judge dismisses him as absolved, solely because the penalty was facultative or because the judge used the power mentioned in cann. 1409, `1 and 1415.
`2. The promoter of justice can appeal whenever it appears that the reparation of scandal or the restitution of justice has not been provided sufficiently.
'''
Canon1482 = '''
Canon 1482: In any stage and grade of the penal trial, if it becomes clearly proven that the offense was not perpetrated by the accused, the judge must declare this in a sentence and absolve the accused, even if it is also proven that the criminal action is terminated.

#Art. III.  Action for Reparation of Damages
Canon1483 = '''
Canon 1483: `1. In accordance with the norm of can. 1276, an injured party can exercise in the penal trial itself a contentious action for the repairing of damages sustained due to the offense.
`2. The intervention of an injured party is not admitted afterwards if it was not made in the first grade of the penal trial.
`3. The appeal in a case for damages is made in accordance with cann. 1309-1321 even if an appeal in the penal trial cannot be made; but if both appeals are proposed, though by different parties, there is to be a single appellate trial with due regard for can. 1484.
'''
Canon1484 = '''
Canon 1484: `1. To avoid excessive delays in a penal trial, the judge can postpone a trial for damages until he has rendered a definitive sentence in the penal trial.
`2. The judge who does this must take cognizance of damages after rendering the sentence in a penal trial even if the penal trial is still pending due to a proposed challenge or if the accused has been acquitted for a reason which does not take away the obligation of repairing the damages.
'''
Canon1485 = '''
Canon 1485: Even if the sentence rendered in the penal trial has become a res iudicata, in no way does it establish the right of the injured party unless this party has intervened in accordance with can. 1483.

#Chapter II.  The Imposition of Penalties by Extra-judicial Decree
Canon1486 = '''
Canon 1486: `1. For the validity of the decree by which a penalty is imposed, it is required that:
1` the accused be informed of the accusation and the proofs and be given the opportunity of fully exercising the right of self-defense, unless having been cited according to the norm of law, the person has neglected to appear.
2` an oral discussion be held before the hierarch or his delegate and the accused with the promoter of justice and a notary present;
3` there be set forth in the decree itself the reasons in fact and in law on which the penalty is based.
`2. However the penalties mentioned in can. 1426, `1 can be imposed without this procedure so long as they have been accepted in writing by the guilty party.
'''
Canon1487 = '''
Canon 1487: `1. Recourse against the decree by which a penalty is imposed can be made to the competent higher authority within ten available days (tempus utile) after it has been communicated.

They begin to oblige after three months have elapsed from the date of that issue of the Acta, unless because of the nature of the matter they bind immediately or unless a shorter or a longer interval has been expressly prescribed in the law itself.
`2. Laws given by other legislators are promulgated in the manner determined by these legislators and begin to oblige from the date prescribed by them.

Canon1490 = '''
Canon 1490: Merely ecclesiastical laws bind those baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it, who have sufficient use of reason and, unless the law itself expressly provides otherwise, who have completed their seventh year of age.

Canon1491 = '''
Canon 1491: `1. Laws passed by the supreme authority of the Church are binding everywhere on all those for whom they were enacted, unless they were for a particular territory; other laws have force only in the territory where the authority that promulgated them exercises power of governance, unless otherwise provided by law or is clear from the nature of the matter.
`2. Without prejudice to the provisions of 3, n. 1, laws passed for a particular territory bind those for whom they were enacted and who have a domicile or quasi-domicile in that territory and are actually residing in it.
`3. Travelers:
1` are not bound by the particular laws of their own territory as long as they are absent from it, unless their violation would cause harm in their own territory or unless the laws are personal ones;
2` are not bound by the particular laws of the territory in which they are present with the exception of those laws which provide for public order, which determine the formalities of legal actions, or which deal with immovable goods situated in that territory;
3` are bound, however, by the common law and the particular law of their own Church sui iuris, even if the latter is not in force in their own territory; but they are not bound by the same laws if these do not bind in the place where they are present.
`4. Transients are bound by all the laws which are in force in the place where they are present.

Canon1492 = '''
Canon 1492: Laws enacted by the supreme authority of the Church, in which the passive subject is not expressly indicated, affect only the Christian faithful of the Eastern Churches insofar as they treat matters of faith or morals or declarations of divine law or these Christian faithful are explicitly included in these laws or they grant a favor which contains nothing contrary to the Eastern rites.

Canon1493 = '''
Canon 1493: `1. Beyond the laws and legitimate customs of the universal law, this Code also includes by the designation "common law" the laws and legitimate customs common to all Eastern Churches.

Canon1496 = '''
Canon 1496: When there is a doubt of law, laws do not bind even if they be nullifying and disqualifying ones. When there is a doubt of fact, however, hierarchs can dispense from them. In the latter case, if it is a question of a reserved dispensation, the hierarch can dispense so long as the dispensation is usually granted by the authority to whom it is reserved.
'''
Canon1497 = '''
Canon 1497: `1. Ignorance or error concerning invalidating or disqualifying laws does not hinder their effectiveness unless it is expressly determined otherwise.
`2. Ignorance or error about a law, a penalty, a fact concerning oneself, or a notorious fact concerning another is not presumed; it is presumed about a fact concerning another which is not notorious until the contrary is proven.
'''
Canon1498 = '''
Canon 1498: `1. Laws are authentically interpreted by the legislator and by the one to whom the legislator had granted the power to interpret them authentically.
`2. An authentic interpretation communicated in the form of a law has the same force as the law itself and must be promulgated. Furthermore, if such an interpretation merely declares what was certain in the words of the law in themselves, it has retroactive force; if it restricts or extends the law or if it explains a doubtful law, it is not retroactive.
`3. However, an interpretation contained in a judicial sentence or an administrative act in a particular matter does not have the force of law and binds only the persons and affects only those matters for which it was given.
'''
Canon1499 = '''
Canon 1499: Laws are to be understood in accord with the proper meaning of the words considered in their text and context. If the meaning remains doubtful and obscure, recourse is to be taken to parallel passages, if such exist, to the purpose and the circumstances of the law, and to the mind of the legislator.

Canon1502 = '''
Canon 1502: `1. A later law abrogates a former law or derogates from it if it expressly states so, if it is directly contrary to it, or if it entirely re-orders the subject matter of the former law.
`2. A prescription of the common law, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, does not derogate from a particular law nor does a norm of particular law enacted for a Church sui iuris derogate from a more particular norm in force in that same Church
'''
Canon1503 = '''
Canon 1503: In a case of doubt the revocation of a pre-existent law is not presumed, but later laws are to be related to earlier ones and, insofar as it is possible, harmonized with them.

Canon1507 = '''
Canon 1507: `1. Only that custom can have the force of law which is reasonable and introduced by a community capable at least of receiving law, and has been the continuous and uncontested practice for the prescribed time determined by law.
`2. A custom which is expressly reprobated in law is not a reasonable one.
`3. A custom contrary to the current canon law or one which is apart (praeter legem) from canon law, obtains the force of law only when it has been legitimately observed for thirty continuous and complete years; only a centenary or immemorial custom can prevail over a canon which contains a clause forbidding future customs.
`4. Even before that time, a competent legislator can approve a custom as legitimate by his consent, even tacitly.

Canon1508 = '''
Canon 1508: Custom is the best interpreter of law.

Canon1509 = '''
Canon 1509: A custom, whether it is contrary to or apart (praeter legem) from the law, is revoked by a contrary custom or law; however, unless it makes express mention of centenary or immemorial customs, a law does not revoke them; as for the other customs, can. 1502, `2 is applicable.

Canon 1510: `1. Administrative acts can be issued by those who enjoy executive power, within the limits of their competence, as well as by those who have received such a power explicitly or implicitly either by the law itself or by legitimate delegation.
`2. Administrative acts are above all:
1` decrees by which for a special case a decision is given or a canonical provision is made;
2` individual precepts by which a person or determined persons are requested directly and legitimately to do or to omit something, especially pertaining to urging the observance of a law;
3` rescripts by which a privilege, a dispensation, a permission or another favor is granted.

Canon1511 = '''
Canon 1511: An administrative act has effect from the moment when it is communicated or in rescripts from the time when the letter is issued; however, if the application of the administrative act is entrusted to an executor, the effect takes place at the time of its execution.

Canon1512 = '''
Canon 1512: `1. An administrative act is to be understood in accord with the proper meaning of the words and the common usage of speech, and must not be extended to cases other than those actually expressed in it.
`2. In doubt, a strict interpretation is to be given to those administrative acts which concern litigation or threaten or inflict penalties, or restrict the rights of persons, or harm the acquired rights of others, or run counter to a law in favor of private persons; all other administrative acts are to be widely interpreted.
`3. Privileges always are to be interpreted so that their beneficiaries actually receive some favor.
`4. Not only a dispensation, but also the very power of dispensing for a particular case are to interpreted strictly.
'''
Canon1513 = '''
Canon 1513: `1. No administrative act is revoked by a contrary law, unless it is provided otherwise in the law itself or the law is enacted by the authority superior to the one who issued the administrative act.
`2. Unless it is expressly provided otherwise in the law, an administrative act does not cease with the termination of the authority of the one who issued it.
`3. The revocation of an administrative act by means of another administrative act of competent authority takes effect only from the moment at which the latter act has been made known to the person for whom it has been given.
`4. A dispensation which has successive applications ceases also by the certain and complete cessation of the motivating cause.
`5. An individual decree or precept ceases to have force also through the cessation of the law for whose execution it has been issued; a singular precept ceases on the termination of the authority of the one who issued it, unless it has been imposed through a legitimate document.

`2. If recourse to the authority which has reserved to itself a dispensation is difficult, and at the same time there is a danger of grave harm in delay, any hierarch in a particular case can dispense the Christian faithful who are subject to him according to the norm of the law, provided that is concerns a dispensation which the same authority is used to grant under the same circumstances, with due regard for can. 396.
