GLOSSARY
PROMULGATION OF THE NEW CODE OF CANON LAW
'''
Canon1 = '''
Canon 1 The canons of this Code regard only the Latin Church.
'''
Canon2 = '''
Canon 2 For the most part the Code does not define the rites which must be observed in celebrating liturgical actions.  Therefore, liturgical laws in force until now retain their force unless one of them is contrary to the canons of the Code.
'''
Canon3 = '''
Canon 3 The canons of the Code neither abrogate nor derogate from the agreements entered into by the Apostolic See with nations or other political societies.  These agreements therefore continue in force exactly as at present, notwithstanding contrary prescripts of this Code.
'''
Canon4 = '''
Canon 4 Acquired rights and privileges granted to physical or juridic persons up to this time by the Apostolic See remain intact if they are in use and have not been revoked, unless the canons of this Code expressly revoke them.
'''
Canon5 = '''
Canon 5 `1. Universal or particular customs presently in force which are contrary to the prescripts of these canons and are reprobated by the canons of this Code are absolutely suppressed and are not permitted to revive in the future.  Other contrary customs are also considered suppressed unless the Code expressly provides otherwise or unless they are centenary or immemorial customs which can be tolerated if, in the judgment of the ordinary, they cannot be removed due to the circumstances of places and persons.
`2. Universal or particular customs beyond the law (praeter ius) which are in force until now are preserved.
'''
Canon6 = '''
Canon 6 `1. When this Code takes force, the following are abrogated:
1` the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917;
2` other universal or particular laws contrary to the prescripts of this Code unless other provision is expressly made for particular laws;
3` any universal or particular penal laws whatsoever issued by the Apostolic See unless they are contained in this Code;
4` other universal disciplinary laws regarding matter which this Code completely reorders.
`2. Insofar as they repeat former law, the canons of this Code must be assessed also in accord with canonical tradition.
'''
Canon7 = '''
Canon 7 A law is established when it is promulgated.
'''
Canon8 = '''
Canon 8 `1. Universal ecclesiastical laws are promulgated by publication in the official commentary, Acta Apostolicae Sedis, unless another manner of promulgation has been prescribed in particular cases.  They take force only after three months have elapsed from the date of that issue of the Acta unless they bind immediately from the very nature of the matter, or the law itself has specifically and expressly established a shorter or longer suspensive period (vacatio).
`2. Particular laws are promulgated in the manner determined by the legislator and begin to oblige a month after the day of promulgation unless the law itself establishes another time period.
'''
Canon9 = '''
Canon 9 Laws regard the future, not the past, unless they expressly provide for the past.
'''
Canon10 = '''
Canon 10 Only those laws must be considered invalidating or disqualifying which expressly establish that an act is null or that a person is unqualified.
'''
Canon11 = '''
Canon 11 Merely ecclesiastical laws bind those who have been baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it, possess the sufficient use of reason, and, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, have completed seven years of age.
'''
Canon12 = '''
Canon 12 `1. Universal laws bind everywhere all those for whom they were issued.
`2. All who are actually present in a certain territory, however, are exempted from universal laws which are not in force in that territory.
`3. Laws established for a particular territory bind those for whom they were issued as well as those who have a domicile or quasi-domicile there and who at the same time are actually residing there, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 13.
'''
Canon13 = '''
Canon 13 `1. Particular laws are not presumed to be personal but territorial unless it is otherwise evident.
`2. Travelers are not bound:
1` by the particular laws of their own territory as long as they are absent from it unless either the transgression of those laws causes harm in their own territory or the laws are personal;
2` by the laws of the territory in which they are present, with the exception of those laws which provide for public order, which determine the formalities of acts, or which regard immovable goods located in the territory.
`3. Transients are bound by both universal and particular laws which are in force in the place where they are present.
'''
Canon14 = '''
Canon 14 Laws, even invalidating and disqualifying ones, do not oblige when there is a doubt about the law.  When there is a doubt about a fact, however, ordinaries can dispense from laws provided that, if it concerns a reserved dispensation, the authority to whom it is reserved usually grants it.
'''
Canon15 = '''
Canon 15 `1. Ignorance or error about invalidating or disqualifying laws does not impede their effect unless it is expressly established otherwise.
`2. Ignorance or error about a law, a penalty, a fact concerning oneself, or a notorious fact concerning another is not presumed; it is presumed about a fact concerning another which is not notorious until the contrary is proven.
'''
Canon16 = '''
Canon 16 `1. The legislator authentically interprets laws as does the one to whom the same legislator has entrusted the power of authentically interpreting.
`2. An authentic interpretation put forth in the form of law has the same force as the law itself and must be promulgated.  If it only declares the words of the law which are certain in themselves, it is retroactive; if it restricts or extends the law, or if it explains a doubtful law, it is not retroactive.
`3. An interpretation in the form of a judicial sentence or of an administrative act in a particular matter, however, does not have the force of law and only binds the persons for whom and affects the matters for which it was given.
'''
Canon17 = '''
Canon 17 Ecclesiastical laws must be understood in accord with the proper meaning of the words considered in their text and context.  If the meaning remains doubtful and obscure, recourse must be made to parallel places, if there are such, to the purpose and circumstances of the law, and to the mind of the legislator.
'''
Canon18 = '''
Canon 18 Laws which establish a penalty, restrict the free exercise of rights, or contain an exception from the law are subject to strict interpretation.

Canon 20 A later law abrogates, or derogates from, an earlier law if it states so expressly, is directly contrary to it, or completely reorders the entire matter of the earlier law.

Canon26 = '''
Canon 26 Unless the competent legislator has specifically approved it, a custom contrary to the canon law now in force or one beyond a canonical law (praeter legem canonicam) obtains the force of law only if it has been legitimately observed for thirty continuous and complete years.

They do not, however, cease when the authority of the one who established them expires unless the contrary is expressly provided.

Canon34 = '''
Canon 34 `1. Instructions clarify the prescripts of laws and elaborate on and determine the methods to be observed in fulfilling them.

`2. Public juridic persons are given this personality either by the law itself or by a special decree of competent authority expressly granting it.  Private juridic persons are given this personality only through a special decree of competent authority expressly granting it.

Canon117 = '''
Canon 117 No aggregate of persons (universitas personarum) or of things (universitas rerum), intending to obtain juridic personality, is able to acquire it unless competent authority has approved its statutes.

Canon118 = '''
Canon 118 Representing a public juridic person and acting in its name are those whose competence is acknowledged by universal or particular law or by its own statutes.  Representing a private juridic person are those whose competence is granted by statute.

Canon119 = '''
Canon 119 With regard to collegial acts, unless the law or statutes provide otherwise:
1` if it concerns elections, when the majority of those who must be convoked are present, that which is approved by the absolute majority of those present has the force of law; after two indecisive ballots, a vote is to be taken on the two candidates who have obtained the greater number of votes or, if there are several, on the two senior in age; after the third ballot, if a tie remains, the one who is senior in age is considered elected;
2` if it concerns other affairs, when an absolute majority of those who must be convoked are present, that which is approved by the absolute majority of those present has the force of law; if after two ballots the votes are equal, the one presiding can break the tie by his or her vote;
3` what touches all as individuals, however, must be approved by all.
'''
Canon120 = '''
Canon 120 `1. A juridic person is perpetual by its nature; nevertheless, it is extinguished if it is legitimately suppressed by competent authority or has ceased to act for a hundred years.  A private juridic person, furthermore, is extinguished if the association is dissolved according to the norm of its statutes or if, in the judgment of competent authority, the foundation has ceased to exist according to the norm of its statutes.
`2. If even one of the members of a collegial juridic person survives, and the aggregate of persons (universitas personarum) has not ceased to exist according to its statutes, that member has the exercise of all the rights of the aggregate (universitas).
'''
Canon121 = '''
Canon 121 If aggregates of persons (universitates personarum) or of things (universitates rerum), which are public juridic persons, are so joined that from them one aggregate (universitas) is constituted which also possesses juridic personality, this new juridic person obtains the goods and patrimonial rights proper to the prior ones and assumes the obligations with which they were burdened.  With regard to the allocation of goods in particular and to the fulfillment of obligations, however, the intention of the founders and donors as well as acquired rights must be respected.
'''
Canon122 = '''
Canon 122 If an aggregate (universitas) which possesses public juridic personality is so divided either that a part of it is united with another juridic person or that a distinct public juridic person is erected from the separated part, the ecclesiastical authority competent to make the division, having observed before all else the intention of the founders and donors, the acquired rights, and the approved statutes, must take care personally or through an executor:
1` that common, divisible, patrimonial goods and rights as well as debts and other obligations are divided among the juridic persons concerned, with due proportion in equity and justice, after all the circumstances and needs of each have been taken into account;
2` that the use and usufruct of common goods which are not divisible accrue to each juridic person and that the obligations proper to them are imposed upon each, in due proportion determined in equity and justice.
'''
Canon123 = '''
Canon 123 Upon the extinction of a public juridic person, the allocation of its goods, patrimonial rights, and obligations is governed by law and its statutes; if these give no indication, they go to the juridic person immediately superior, always without prejudice to the intention of the founders and donors and acquired rights.  Upon the extinction of a private juridic person, the allocation of its goods and obligations is governed by its own statutes.
'''
Canon124 = '''
Canon 124 `1. For the validity of a juridic act it is required that the act is placed by a qualified person and includes those things which essentially constitute the act itself as well as the formalities and requirements imposed by law for the validity of the act.
`2. A juridic act placed correctly with respect to its external elements is presumed valid.
'''
Canon125 = '''
Canon 125 `1. An act placed out of force inflicted on a person from without, which the person was not able to resist in any way, is considered as never to have taken place.
`2. An act placed out of grave fear, unjustly inflicted, or out of malice is valid unless the law provides otherwise.  It can be rescinded, however, through the sentence of a judge, either at the instance of the injured party or of the party's successors in law, or ex officio.
'''
Canon126 = '''
Canon 126 An act placed out of ignorance or out of error concerning something which constitutes its substance or which amounts to a condition sine qua non is invalid.  Otherwise it is valid unless the law makes other provision.  An act entered into out of ignorance or error, however, can give rise to a rescissory action according to the norm of law.
'''
Canon127 = '''
Canon 127 `1. When it is established by law that in order to place acts a superior needs the consent or counsel of some college or group of persons, the college or group must be convoked according to the norm of can. 166 unless, when it concerns seeking counsel only, particular or proper law provides otherwise.  For such acts to be valid, however, it is required that the consent of an absolute majority of those present is obtained or that the counsel of all is sought.
`2. When it is established by law that in order to place acts a superior needs the consent or counsel of certain persons as individuals:
1` if consent is required, the act of a superior who does not seek the consent of those persons or who acts contrary to the opinion of all or any of them is invalid;
2` if counsel is required, the act of a superior who does not hear those persons is invalid; although not obliged to accept their opinion even if unanimous, a superior is nonetheless not to act contrary to that opinion, especially if unanimous, without a reason which is overriding in the superior's judgment.
`3. All whose consent or counsel is required are obliged to offer their opinion sincerely and, if the gravity of the affair requires it, to observe secrecy diligently; moreover, the superior can insist upon this obligation.

Canon129 = '''
Canon 129 `1. Those who have received sacred orders are qualified, according to the norm of the prescripts of the law, for the power of governance, which exists in the Church by divine institution and is also called the power of jurisdiction.
`2. Lay members of the Christian faithful can cooperate in the exercise of this same power according to the norm of law.
'''
Canon130 = '''
Canon 130 Of itself, the power of governance is exercised for the external forum; sometimes, however, it is exercised for the internal forum alone, so that the effects which its exercise is meant to have for the external forum are not recognized there, except insofar as the law establishes it in determined cases.
'''
Canon131 = '''
Canon 131 `1. The ordinary power of governance is that which is joined to a certain office by the law itself; delegated, that which is granted to a person but not by means of an office.
`2. The ordinary power of governance can be either proper or vicarious.
`3. The burden of proving delegation rests on the one who claims to have been delegated.
'''
Canon132 = '''
Canon 132 `1. Habitual faculties are governed by the prescripts for delegated power.
`2. Nevertheless, unless the grant expressly provides otherwise or the ordinary was chosen for personal qualifications, a habitual faculty granted to an ordinary is not withdrawn when the authority of the ordinary to whom it was granted expires, even if he has begun to execute it, but the faculty transfers to any ordinary who succeeds him in governance.
'''
Canon133 = '''
Canon 133 `1. A delegate who exceeds the limits of the mandate with respect to either matters or persons does not act at all.
`2. A delegate who carries out those things for which the person was delegated in some manner other than that determined in the mandate is not considered to exceed the limits of the mandate unless the manner was prescribed for validity by the one delegating.
'''
Canon134 = '''
Canon 134 `1. In addition to the Roman Pontiff, by the title of ordinary are understood in the law diocesan bishops and others who, even if only temporarily, are placed over some particular church or a community equivalent to it according to the norm of can. 368 as well as those who possess general ordinary executive power in them, namely, vicars general and episcopal vicars; likewise, for their own members, major superiors of clerical religious institutes of pontifical right and of clerical societies of apostolic life of pontifical right who at least possess ordinary executive power.
`2. By the title of local ordinary are understood all those mentioned in `1 except the superiors of religious institutes and of societies of apostolic life.
`3. Within the context of executive power, those things which in the canons are attributed by name to the diocesan bishop are understood to belong only to a diocesan bishop and to the others made equivalent to him in can. 381, `2, excluding the vicar general and episcopal vicar except by special mandate.
'''
Canon135 = '''
Canon 135 `1. The power of governance is distinguished as legislative, executive, and judicial.
`2. Legislative power must be exercised in the manner prescribed by law; that which a legislator below the supreme authority possesses in the Church cannot be validly delegated unless the law explicitly provides otherwise.  A lower legislator cannot validly issue a law contrary to higher law.
`3. Judicial power, which judges or judicial colleges possess, must be exercised in the manner prescribed by law and cannot be delegated except to perform acts preparatory to some decree or sentence.
`4. In what pertains to the exercise of executive power, the prescripts of the following canons are to be observed.
'''
Canon136 = '''
Canon 136 Unless the nature of the matter or a prescript of law establishes otherwise, a person is able to exercise executive power over his subjects, even when he or they are outside his territory; he is also able to exercise this power over travelers actually present in the territory if it concerns granting favors or executing universal laws or particular laws which bind them according to the norm of can. 13, `2, n. 2.
'''
Canon137 = '''
Canon 137 `1. Ordinary executive power can be delegated both for a single act and for all cases unless the law expressly provides otherwise.
`2. Executive power delegated by the Apostolic See can be subdelegated for a single act or for all cases unless the delegate was chosen for personal qualifications or subdelegation was expressly forbidden.
`3. Executive power delegated by another authority who has ordinary power can be subdelegated only for individual cases if it was delegated for all cases.  If it was delegated for a single act or for determined acts, however, it cannot be subdelegated except by express grant of the one delegating.
`4. No subdelegated power can be subdelegated again unless the one delegating has expressly granted this.
'''
Canon138 = '''
Canon 138 Ordinary executive power as well as power delegated for all cases must be interpreted broadly; any other, however, must be interpreted strictly.  Nevertheless, one who has delegated power is understood to have been granted also those things without which the delegate cannot exercise this power.
'''
Canon139 = '''
Canon 139 `1. Unless the law determines otherwise, the fact that a person approaches some competent authority, even a higher one, does not suspend the executive power, whether ordinary or delegated, of another competent authority.
`2. Nevertheless, a lower authority is not to become involved in cases submitted to a higher authority except for a grave and urgent cause; in this case, the lower authority is immediately to notify the higher concerning the matter.
'''
Canon140 = '''
Canon 140 `1. When several persons have been delegated in solidum to transact the same affair, the one who first begins to deal with it excludes the others from doing so unless that person subsequently was impeded or did not wish to proceed further in carrying it out.
`2. When several persons have been delegated collegially to transact an affair, all must proceed according to the norm of can. 119 unless the mandate has provided otherwise.
`3. Executive power delegated to several persons is presumed to be delegated to them in solidum.
'''
Canon141 = '''
Canon 141 When several persons have been delegated successively, that person is to take care of the affair whose mandate is the earlier and has not been subsequently revoked.
'''
Canon142 = '''
Canon 142 `1. Delegated power ceases: by fulfillment of the mandate; by expiration of the time or completion of the number of cases for which it was granted; by cessation of the purpose for the delegation; by revocation of the one delegating directly communicated to the delegate as well as by resignation of the delegate made known to and accepted by the one delegating.  It does not cease, however, when the authority of the one delegating expires unless this appears in attached clauses.
`2. Nevertheless, an act of delegated power which is exercised for the internal forum alone and is placed inadvertently after the lapse of the time limit of the grant is valid.
'''
Canon143 = '''
Canon 143 `1. Ordinary power ceases by loss of the office to which it is connected.
`2. Unless the law provides otherwise, ordinary power is suspended if, legitimately, an appeal is made or a recourse is lodged against privation of or removal from office.

Canon144 = '''
Canon 144 `1. In factual or legal common error and in positive and probable doubt of law or of fact, the Church supplies executive power of governance for both the external and internal forum.

Canon 149 `1. To be promoted to an ecclesiastical office, a person must be in the communion of the Church as well as suitable, that is, endowed with those qualities which are required for that office by universal or particular law or by the law of the foundation.
`2. Provision of an ecclesiastical office made to one who lacks the requisite qualities is invalid only if the qualities are expressly required for the validity of the provision by universal or particular law or by the law of the foundation.  Otherwise it is valid but can be rescinded by decree of competent authority or by sentence of an administrative tribunal.

Canon163 = '''
Canon 163 The authority competent to install the person presented according to the norm of law is to install the one legitimately presented whom the authority has found suitable and who has accepted.

Canon166 = '''
Canon 166 `1. The person presiding over a college or group is to convoke all those belonging to the college or group; the notice of convocation, however, when it must be personal, is valid if it is given in the place of domicile or quasi-domicile or in the place of residence.
`2. If anyone of those to be convoked was overlooked and for that reason was absent, the election is valid.  Nevertheless, at the instance of that same person and when the oversight and absence have been proved, the election must be rescinded by the competent authority even if it has been confirmed, provided that it is evident juridically that recourse had been made at least within three days from the notice of the election.

1` the necessity or advantage of his own particular church demands it, and without prejudice to the prescripts of the law concerning the decent support of clerics;
2` he knows by a lawful document that excardination has been granted, and has also obtained from the excardinating bishop, under secrecy if need be, appropriate testimonials concerning the cleric's life, behavior and studies;
3` the cleric has declared in writing to the same diocesan bishop that he wishes to be dedicated to the service of the new particular church according to the norm of law.
'''
Canon270 = '''
Canon 270 Excardination can be licitly granted only for just causes such as the advantage of the Church or the good of the cleric himself.

'''
Canon271 = '''
Canon 271 `1. Apart from the case of true necessity of his own particular church, a diocesan bishop is not to deny permission to clerics, whom he knows are prepared and considers suitable and who request it, to move to regions laboring under a grave lack of clergy where they will exercise the sacred ministry.  He is also to make provision that the rights and duties of these clerics are determined through a written agreement with the diocesan bishop of the place they request.
`2. A diocesan bishop can grant permission for his clerics to move to another particular church for a predetermined time, which can even be renewed several times.  Nevertheless, this is to be done so that these clerics remain incardinated in their own particular church and, when they return to it, possess all the rights which they would have had if they had been dedicated to the sacred ministry there.
`3. For a just cause the diocesan bishop can recall a cleric who has moved legitimately to another particular church while remaining incardinated in his own church provided that the agreements entered into with the other bishop and natural equity are observed; the diocesan bishop of the other particular church, after having observed these same conditions and for a just cause, likewise can deny the same cleric permission for further residence in his territory.

Canon276 = '''
Canon 276 `1. In leading their lives, clerics are bound in a special way to pursue holiness since, having been consecrated to God by a new title in the reception of orders, they are dispensers of the mysteries of God in the service of His people.
`2. In order to be able to pursue this perfection:
1` they are first of all to fulfill faithfully and tirelessly the duties of the pastoral ministry;

'''
Canon277 = '''
Canon 277 `1. Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.
`2. Clerics are to behave with due prudence towards persons whose company can endanger their obligation to observe continence or give rise to scandal among the faithful.

`2. Provision must also be made so that they possess that social assistance which provides for their needs suitably if they suffer from illness, incapacity, or old age.
`3. Married deacons who devote themselves completely to ecclesiastical ministry deserve remuneration by which they are able to provide for the support of themselves and their families.

Canon 834 `1. The Church fulfills its sanctifying function in a particular way through the sacred liturgy, which is an exercise of the priestly function of Jesus Christ.

In the sacred liturgy, the whole public worship of God is carried out by the Head and members of the mystical Body of Jesus Christ.
`2. Such worship takes place when it is carried out in the name of the Church by persons legitimately designated and through acts approved by the authority of the Church.
'''
Canon835 = '''

Accordingly, in the celebration of the sacraments the sacred ministers and the other members of the Christian faithful must use the greatest veneration and necessary diligence.

`3. Catholic ministers administer the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick licitly to members of Eastern Churches which do not have full communion with the Catholic Church if they seek such on their own accord and are properly disposed.

Nevertheless, if a Catholic party contracts marriage with a non-Catholic party of an Eastern rite, the canonical form of the celebration must be observed for liceity only; for validity, however, the presence of a priest is required and the other requirements of law are to be observed.
`2. If grave difficulties hinder the observance of canonical form, the local ordinary of the Catholic party has the right of dispensing from the form in individual cases, after having consulted the ordinary of the place in which the marriage is celebrated and with some public form of celebration for validity.  It is for the conference of bishops to establish norms by which the aforementioned dispensation is to be granted in a uniform manner.
`3. It is forbidden to have another religious celebration of the same marriage to give or renew matrimonial consent before or after the canonical celebration according to the norm of `1. Likewise, there is not to be a religious celebration in which the Catholic who is assisting and a non-Catholic minister together, using their own rites, ask for the consent of the parties.

Canon1143 = '''
Canon 1143 `1. A marriage entered into by two non-baptized persons is dissolved by means of the Pauline privilege in favor of the faith of the party who has received baptism by the very fact that a new marriage is contracted by the same party, provided that the non-baptized party departs.
`2. The non-baptized party is considered to depart if he or she does not wish to cohabit with the baptized party or to cohabit peacefully without affront to the Creator unless the baptized party, after baptism was received, has given the other a just cause for departing.

`2. In the cases mentioned in `1, marriage must be contracted in legitimate form after baptism has been received, and the prescripts about mixed marriages, if necessary, and other matters required by the law are to be observed.

`2. Tacit condonation exists if the innocent spouse has had marital relations voluntarily with the other spouse after having become certain of the adultery.  It is presumed, moreover, if the spouse observed conjugal living for six months and did not make recourse to the ecclesiastical or civil authority.
`3. If the innocent spouse has severed conjugal living voluntarily, the spouse is to introduce a cause for separation within six months to the competent ecclesiastical authority which, after having investigated all the circumstances, is to consider carefully whether the innocent spouse can be moved to forgive the fault and not to prolong the separation permanently.

Canon 1309 The authorities mentioned in can. 1308 also have the power to transfer, for an appropriate cause, the obligations of Masses to days, churches, or altars different from those determined in the foundations.
'''
Canon1310 = '''
Canon 1310 `1. The ordinary, only for a just and necessary cause, can reduce, moderate, or commute the wills of the faithful for pious causes if the founder has expressly entrusted this power to him.
`2. If through no fault of the administrators the fulfillment of the imposed obligations has become impossible because of diminished revenues or some other cause, the ordinary can equitably lessen these obligations, after having heard those concerned and his own finance council and with the intention of the founder preserved as much as possible; this does not hold for the reduction of Masses, which is governed by the prescripts of can. 1308.
`3. In other cases, recourse is to be made to the Apostolic See.

Canon1311 = '''
Canon 1311 The Church has the innate and proper right to coerce offending members of the Christian faithful with penal sanctions.
'''
Canon1312 = '''
Canon 1312 `1. The following are penal sanctions in the Church:
1` medicinal penalties, or censures, which are listed in cann. 1331-1333;
2` expiatory penalties mentioned in can. 1336.
`2. The law can establish other expiatory penalties which deprive a member of the Christian faithful of some spiritual or temporal good and which are consistent with the supernatural purpose of the Church.
`3. Penal remedies and penances are also used; the former especially to prevent delicts, the latter to substitute for or to increase a penalty.
'''
Canon1313 = '''
Canon 1313 `1. If a law is changed after a delict has been committed, the law more favorable to the accused is to be applied.
`2. If a later law abolishes a law or at least the penalty, the penalty immediately ceases.
'''
Canon1314 = '''
Canon 1314 Generally, a penalty is ferendae sententiae, so that it does not bind the guilty party until after it has been imposed; if the law or precept expressly establishes it, however, a penalty is latae sententiae, so that it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed.
'''
Canon1315 = '''
Canon 1315 `1. A person who has legislative power can also issue penal laws; within the limits of his competence by reason of territory or of persons, moreover, he can by his own laws also strengthen with an appropriate penalty a divine law or an ecclesiastical law issued by a higher authority.
`2. The law itself can determine a penalty, or its determination can be left to the prudent appraisal of a judge.
`3. Particular law also can add other penalties to those established by universal law for some delict; however, this is not to be done except for very grave necessity.  If universal law threatens an indeterminate or facultative penalty, particular law can also establish a determinate or obligatory one in its place.

Canon 1318 A legislator is not to threaten latae sententiae penalties except possibly for certain singularly malicious delicts which either can result in graver scandal or cannot be punished effectively by ferendae sententiae penalties; he is not, however, to establish censures, especially excommunication, except with the greatest moderation and only for graver delicts.
'''
Canon1319 = '''
Canon 1319 `1. Insofar as a person can impose precepts in the external forum in virtue of the power of governance, the person can also threaten determinate penalties by precept, except perpetual expiatory penalties.
`2. A penal precept is not to be issued unless the matter has been considered thoroughly and those things established in cann. 1317 and 1318 about particular laws have been observed.
'''
Canon1320 = '''
Canon 1320 The local ordinary can coerce religious with penalties in all those matters in which they are subject to him.

Canon1321 = '''
Canon 1321 `1. No one is punished unless the external violation of a law or precept, committed by the person, is gravely imputable by reason of malice or negligence.
`2. A penalty established by a law or precept binds the person who has deliberately violated the law or precept; however, a person who violated a law or precept by omitting necessary diligence is not punished unless the law or precept provides otherwise.
`3. When an external violation has occurred, imputability is presumed unless it is otherwise apparent.

Canon 1323 The following are not subject to a penalty when they have violated a law or precept:
1` a person who has not yet completed the sixteenth year of age;
2` a person who without negligence was ignorant that he or she violated a law or precept; inadvertence and error are equivalent to ignorance;
3` a person who acted due to physical force or a chance occurrence which the person could not foresee or, if foreseen, avoid;
4` a person who acted coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls;
5` a person who acted with due moderation against an unjust aggressor for the sake of legitimate self defense or defense of another;
6` a person who lacked the use of reason, without prejudice to the prescripts of cann. 1324, `1, n. 2 and 1325;
7` a person who without negligence thought that one of the circumstances mentioned in nn. 4 or 5 was present.
'''
Canon1324 = '''
Canon 1324 `1. The perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed:
1` by a person who had only the imperfect use of reason;
2` by a person who lacked the use of reason because of drunkenness or another similar culpable disturbance of mind;
3` from grave heat of passion which did not precede and hinder all deliberation of mind and consent of will and provided that the passion itself had not been stimulated or fostered voluntarily;
4` by a minor who has completed the age of sixteen years;
5` by a person who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience if the delict is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls;
6` by a person who acted without due moderation against an unjust aggressor for the sake of legitimate self defense or defense of another;
7` against someone who gravely and unjustly provokes the person;
8` by a person who thought in culpable error that one of the circumstances mentioned in can. 1323, nn. 4 or 5 was present;
9` by a person who without negligence did not know that a penalty was attached to a law or precept;
10` by a person who acted without full imputability provided that the imputability was grave.
`2. A judge can act in the same manner if another circumstance is present which diminishes the gravity of a delict.
`3. In the circumstances mentioned in `1, the accused is not bound by a latae sententiae penalty.
'''
Canon1325 = '''
Canon 1325 Crass, supine, or affected ignorance can never be considered in applying the prescripts of cann. 1323 and 1324; likewise drunkenness or other disturbances of mind cannot be considered if they are sought deliberately in order to commit or excuse a delict, nor can passion which is voluntarily stimulated or fostered.
'''
Canon1326 = '''
Canon 1326 `1. A judge can punish the following more gravely than the law or precept has established:
1` a person who after a condemnation or after the declaration of a penalty continues so to offend that from the circumstances the obstinate ill will of the person can prudently be inferred;
2` a person who has been established in some dignity or who has abused a position of authority or office in order to commit the delict;
3` an accused person who, when a penalty has been established against a delict based on negligence, foresaw the event and nonetheless omitted precautions to avoid it, which any diligent person would have employed.
`2. If the penalty established in the cases mentioned in `1 is latae sententiae, another penalty or a penance can be added.
'''
Canon1327 = '''
Canon 1327 Particular law can establish other exempting, mitigating, or aggravating circumstances besides the cases in cann. 1323-1326, either by general norm or for individual delicts.  Likewise, circumstances can be established in a precept which exempt from, mitigate, or increase a penalty established by the precept.
'''
Canon1328 = '''
Canon 1328 `1. A person who has done or omitted something in order to commit a delict and yet, contrary to his or her intent, did not commit the delict is not bound by the penalty established for a completed delict unless the law or precept provides otherwise.
`2. If the acts or omissions are by their nature conducive to the execution of the delict, however, their perpetrator can be subjected to a penance or penal remedy unless the perpetrator voluntarily ceased from carrying out the delict which had been initiated.  If scandal or some other grave damage or danger resulted, however, the perpetrator, even if he or she voluntarily desisted, can be punished with a just penalty, although one lesser than that established for a completed delict.
'''
Canon1329 = '''
Canon 1329 `1. If ferendae sententiae penalties are established for the principal perpetrator, those who conspire together to commit a delict and are not expressly named in a law or precept are subject to the same penalties or to others of the same or lesser gravity.
`2. Accomplices who are not named in a law or precept incur a latae sententiae penalty attached to a delict if without their assistance the delict would not have been committed, and the penalty is of such a nature that it can affect them; otherwise, they can be punished by ferendae sententiae penalties.

1` the offices or the power of governance which are not under the power of the superior who establishes the penalty;
2` the right of residence which the offender may have by reason of office;
3` the right to administer goods which may pertain to the office of the person suspended if the penalty is latae sententiae.

'''
Canon1335 = '''
Canon 1335 If a censure prohibits the celebration of sacraments or sacramentals or the placing of an act of governance, the prohibition is suspended whenever it is necessary to care for the faithful in danger of death.  If a latae sententiae censure has not been declared, the prohibition is also suspended whenever a member of the faithful requests a sacrament or sacramental or an act of governance; a person is permitted to request this for any just cause.

1` defer the imposition of the penalty to a more opportune time if it is foreseen that greater evils will result from an overly hasty punishment of the offender;
2` abstain from imposing a penalty, impose a lighter penalty, or employ a penance if the offender has reformed and repaired the scandal or if the offender has been or, it is foreseen, will be punished sufficiently by civil authority;
3` suspend the obligation of observing an expiatory penalty if it is the first offense of an offender who has lived a praiseworthy life and if the need to repair scandal is not pressing, but in such a way that if the offender commits an offense again within the time determined by the judge, the person is to pay the penalty due for each delict unless in the interim the time for the prescription of a penal action has elapsed for the first delict.

Canon1345 = '''
Canon 1345 Whenever the offender had only the imperfect use of reason or committed the delict from fear, necessity, the heat of passion, or mental disturbance from drunkenness or something similar, the judge can also abstain from imposing any penalty if he thinks that reform of the person can be better accomplished in another way.

If the civil law does not recognize the force of an arbitrated sentence unless a judge confirms it, an arbitrated sentence in an ecclesiastical controversy, in order to have force in the canonical forum, needs the confirmation of an ecclesiastical judge of the place where it was rendered.
`2. If civil law permits the challenge of an arbitrated judgment before a civil judge, however, the same challenge can be proposed in the canonical forum before an ecclesiastical judge competent to judge the controversy in the first grade.
'''
Canon1717 = '''
Canon 1717 `1. Whenever an ordinary has knowledge, which at least seems true, of a delict, he is carefully to inquire personally or through another suitable person about the facts, circumstances, and imputability, unless such an inquiry seems entirely superfluous.
`2. Care must be taken so that the good name of anyone is not endangered from this investigation.
`3. The person who conducts the investigation has the same powers and obligations as an auditor in the process; the same person cannot act as a judge in the matter if a judicial process is initiated later.
'''
Canon1718 = '''
Canon 1718 `1. When it seems that sufficient evidence has been collected, the ordinary is to decide:
1` whether a process to inflict or declare a penalty can be initiated;
2` whether, attentive to can. 1341, this is expedient;
3` whether a judicial process must be used or, unless the law forbids it, whether the matter must proceed by way of extrajudicial decree.
`2. The ordinary is to revoke or change the decree mentioned in `1 whenever new evidence indicates to him that another decision is necessary.
`3. In issuing the decrees mentioned in ``1 and 2, the ordinary is to hear two judges or other experts of the law if he considers it prudent.
`4. Before he makes a decision according to the norm of `1 and in order to avoid useless trials, the ordinary is to examine carefully whether it is expedient for him or the investigator, with the consent of the parties, to resolve equitably the question of damages.
'''
Canon1719 = '''
Canon 1719 The acts of the investigation, the decrees of the ordinary which initiated and concluded the investigation, and everything which preceded the investigation are to be kept in the secret archive of the curia if they are not necessary for the penal process.
'''
Canon1720 = '''
Canon 1720 If the ordinary thinks that the matter must proceed by way of extrajudicial decree:
1` he is to inform the accused of the accusation and the proofs, giving an opportunity for self-defense, unless the accused neglected to appear after being properly summoned;
2` he is to weigh carefully all the proofs and arguments with two assessors;
3` if the delict is certainly established and a criminal action is not extinguished, he is to issue a decree according to the norm of cann. 1342-1350, setting forth the reasons in law and in fact at least briefly.
'''
Canon1721 = '''
Canon 1721 `1. If the ordinary has decreed that a judicial penal process must be initiated, he is to hand over the acts of the investigation to the promoter of justice who is to present a libellus of accusation to the judge according to the norm of cann. 1502 and 1504.
`2. The promoter of justice appointed to the higher tribunal acts as the petitioner before that tribunal.
'''
Canon1722 = '''
Canon 1722 To prevent scandals, to protect the freedom of witnesses, and to guard the course of justice, the ordinary, after having heard the promoter of justice and cited the accused, at any stage of the process can exclude the accused from the sacred ministry or from some office and ecclesiastical function, can impose or forbid residence in some place or territory, or even can prohibit public participation in the Most Holy Eucharist.  Once the cause ceases, all these measures must be revoked; they also end by the law itself when the penal process ceases.
'''
Canon1723 = '''
Canon 1723 `1. The judge who cites the accused must invite the accused to appoint an advocate according to the norm of can. 1481, `1 within the time limit set by the judge.

'''
Canon1726 = '''
Canon 1726 If at any grade and stage of the penal trial it is evidently established that the accused did not commit the delict, the judge must declare this in a sentence and absolve the accused even if it is also established that criminal action has been extinguished.
'''
Canon1727 = '''
Canon 1727 `1. The accused can propose an appeal even if the sentence dismissed the accused only because the penalty was facultative or because the judge used the power mentioned in cann. 1344 and 1345.
`2. The promoter of justice can appeal whenever the promoter judges that the repair of scandal or the restoration of justice has not been provided for sufficiently.
'''
Canon1728 = '''
Canon 1728 `1. Without prejudice to the prescripts of the canons of this title and unless the nature of the matter precludes it, the canons on trials in general and on the ordinary contentious trial must be applied in a penal trial; the special norms for cases which pertain to the public good are also to be observed.
`2. The accused is not bound to confess the delict nor can an oath be administered to the accused.
'''
Canon1729 = '''
Canon 1729 `1. In the penal trial itself an injured party can bring a contentious action to repair damages incurred personally from the delict, according to the norm of can. 1596.
`2. The intervention of the injured party mentioned in `1 is not admitted later if it was not made in the first grade of the penal trial.
`3. The appeal in a case for damages is made according to the norm of cann. 1628-1640 even if an appeal cannot be made in the penal trial; if both appeals are proposed, although by different parties, there is to be a single appellate trial, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1730.

'''
Canon1731 = '''
Canon 1731 Even if the sentence rendered in a penal trial has become a res iudicata, it in no way establishes the right of the injured party unless this party has intervened according to the norm of can. 1729.
'''
Canon1732 = '''
Canon 1732 What is established in the canons of this section concerning decrees must be applied to all singular administrative acts which are given in the external forum outside a trial excepting those which have been issued by the Roman Pontiff or an ecumenical council.
'''
Canon1733 = '''
Canon 1733 `1. Whenever a person considers himself or herself aggrieved by a decree, it is particularly desirable that the person and the author of the decree avoid any contention and take care to seek an equitable solution by common counsel, possibly using the mediation and effort of wise persons to avoid or settle the controversy in a suitable way.
`2. The conference of bishops can determine that each diocese establish in a stable manner an office or council whose function is to seek and suggest equitable solutions according to the norms determined by the conference.  If the conference has not ordered this, however, the bishop can establish a council or office of this kind.
`3. The office or council mentioned in `2 is especially to be of assistance when the revocation of a decree has been requested according to the norm of can. 1734 and the time limits for making recourse have not elapsed.  If recourse has been proposed against a decree, however, the superior who deals with the recourse is to urge the person making recourse and the author of the decree to seek a solution of this kind whenever he sees hope of a favorable outcome.
'''
Canon1734 = '''
Canon 1734 `1. Before proposing recourse a person must seek the revocation or emendation of the decree in writing from its author.  When this petition is proposed, by that very fact suspension of the execution of the decree is also understood to be requested.
`2. The petition must be made within the peremptory period of ten useful days from the legitimate notification of the decree.
`3. The norms of ``1 and 2 are not valid:
1` for recourse proposed to a bishop against decrees issued by authorities subject to him;
2` for recourse proposed against a decree which decides a hierarchical recourse unless the bishop gave the decision;
3` for recourse proposed according to the norm of cann. 57 and 1735.
'''
Canon1735 = '''
Canon 1735 If within thirty days after receiving the petition mentioned in can. 1734 the author of the decree communicates a new decree by which he either emends the earlier one or decides that the petition must be rejected, the time limits for making recourse run from the notification of the new decree.  If the author makes no decision within the thirty days, however, the time limits run from the thirtieth day.
'''
Canon1736 = '''
Canon 1736 `1. In those matters in which hierarchical recourse suspends the execution of a decree, the petition mentioned in can. 1734 also has the same effect.
`2. In other cases, if the author of the decree has not decreed the suspension of execution within ten days after receiving the petition mentioned in can. 1734, an interim suspension can be sought from his hierarchical superior who can decree a suspension only for grave reasons and always cautiously so that the salvation of souls suffers no harm.
`3. If the execution of the decree has been suspended according to the norm of `2 and recourse is proposed afterwards, the person who must deal with the recourse according to the norm of can. 1737, `3 is to decide whether the suspension must be confirmed or revoked.
`4. If no recourse is proposed against the decree within the established time limit, the interim suspension of the execution given according to the norm of ``1 or 2 ceases by that very fact.
'''
Canon1737 = '''
Canon 1737 `1. A person who claims to have been aggrieved by a decree can make recourse for any just reason to the hierarchical superior of the one who issued the decree.  The recourse can be proposed before the author of the decree who must transmit it immediately to the competent hierarchical superior.
`2. Recourse must be proposed within the peremptory time limit of fifteen useful days which in the cases mentioned in can. 1734, `3 run from the day on which the decree was communicated; in other cases, however, they run according to the norm of can. 1735.
`3. Nevertheless, even in cases in which recourse does not suspend the execution of the decree by the law itself and suspension has not been decreed according to the norm of can. 1736, `2, the superior can order the execution to be suspended for a grave cause, yet cautiously so that the salvation of souls suffers no harm.
'''
Canon1738 = '''
Canon 1738 The person making recourse always has the right to use an advocate or procurator, but useless delays are to be avoided; indeed, a legal representative is to be appointed ex officio if the person making recourse lacks one and the superior thinks it necessary.  Nevertheless, the superior always can order the person making recourse to be present in order to be questioned.
'''
Canon1739 = '''
Canon 1739 The superior who deals with the recourse, as the case warrants, is permitted not only to confirm the decree or declare it invalid but also to rescind or revoke it or, if it seems more expedient to the superior, to emend, replace, or modify it.
'''
Canon1740 = '''
Canon 1740 When the ministry of any pastor becomes harmful or at least ineffective for any cause, even through no grave personal negligence, the diocesan bishop can remove him from the parish.
'''
Canon1741 = '''
Canon 1741 The causes for which a pastor can be removed legitimately from his parish are especially the following:
1` a manner of acting which brings grave detriment or disturbance to ecclesiastical communion;
2` ineptitude or a permanent infirmity of mind or body which renders the pastor unable to fulfill his functions usefully;
3` loss of a good reputation among upright and responsible parishioners or an aversion to the pastor which it appears will not cease in a brief time;
4` grave neglect or violation of parochial duties which persists after a warning;
5` poor administration of temporal affairs with grave damage to the Church whenever another remedy to this harm cannot be found.
'''
Canon1742 = '''
Canon 1742 `1. If the instruction which was carried out has established the existence of one of the causes mentioned in can. 1740, the bishop is to discuss the matter with two pastors selected from the group established for this purpose in a stable manner by the presbyteral council at the proposal of the bishop.  If the bishop then judges that removal must take place, he paternally is to persuade the pastor to resign within fifteen days, after having explained, for validity, the cause and arguments for the removal.
`2. The prescript of can. 682, `2 is to be observed for pastors who are members of a religious institute or a society of apostolic life.
'''
Canon1743 = '''
Canon 1743 A pastor can submit a resignation not only purely and simply but also conditionally, provided that the bishop can accept it legitimately and actually does accept it.
'''
Canon1744 = '''
Canon 1744 `1. If the pastor has not responded within the prescribed days, the bishop is to repeat the invitation and extend the useful time to respond.
`2. If the bishop establishes that the pastor received the second invitation but did not respond even though not prevented by any impediment, or if the pastor refuses to resign without giving any reasons, the bishop is to issue a decree of removal.
'''
Canon1745 = '''
Canon 1745 If the pastor opposes the cause given and its reasons and alleges reasons which seem insufficient to the bishop, the bishop, in order to act validly, is:
1` to invite the pastor to organize his objections in a written report after he has inspected the acts, and offer any proofs he has to the contrary;
2` when any necessary instruction is completed, to consider the matter together with the same pastors mentioned in can. 1742, `1, unless others must be designated because those pastors are unavailable;
3` finally, to establish whether the pastor must be removed or not and promptly to issue a decree on the matter.

Canon1746 = '''
Canon 1746 After the pastor has been removed, the bishop is to make provision either for an assignment to some other office, if he is suitable for this, or for a pension as the case warrants and circumstances permit.

Canon1747 = '''
Canon 1747 `1. The removed pastor must refrain from exercising the function of pastor, vacate the rectory as soon as possible, and hand over everything belonging to the parish to the person to whom the bishop has entrusted the parish.
`2. If, however, the man is sick and cannot be transferred elsewhere from the rectory without inconvenience, the bishop is to leave him the use, even exclusive use, of the rectory while this necessity lasts.
`3. While recourse against a decree of removal is pending, the bishop cannot appoint a new pastor, but is to provide a parochial administrator in the meantime.
'''
Canon1748 = '''
Canon 1748 If the good of souls or the necessity or advantage of the Church demands that a pastor be transferred from a parish which he is governing usefully to another parish or another office, the bishop is to propose the transfer to him in writing and persuade him to consent to it out of love of God and souls.

Canon1751 = '''
Canon 1751 `1. When this has been done, if the pastor still refuses and the bishop thinks that the transfer must be made, he is to issue a decree of transfer, establishing that the parish will be vacant after the lapse of a set time.

_____[NEW APPENDIX (Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus, 15 August 2015)]
The way of proceeding in cases regarding the declaration of the nullity of a marriage

The Third General Assembly of the Extraordinary Synod of Bishops, held in October of 2014, looked into the difficulty the faithful have in approaching church tribunals. Since the bishop, as a good shepherd, must attend to his poor faithful who need particular pastoral care, and given the sure collaboration of the successor of Peter with the bishops in spreading familiarity with the law, it has seemed opportune to offer, together with the detailed norms for the application to the matrimonial process, some tools for the work of the tribunals to respond to the needs of the faithful who seek that the truth about the existence or non-existence of the bond of their failed marriage be declared.

Art. 1. The bishop, under can. 383, `1 is obliged, with an apostolic spirit, to attend to separated or divorced spouses who perhaps, by the conditions of their lives, have abandoned religious practice. He thus shares, together with the parochis (cf. can. 529, `1), the pastoral solicitude for these faithful in difficulties.

Art. 2. The pre-judicial or pastoral inquiry, which in the context of diocesan and parish structures receives those separated or divorced faithful who have doubts regarding the validity of their marriage or are convinced of its nullity, is, in the end, directed toward understanding their situation and to gathering the material useful for the eventual judicial process, be it the ordinary or the briefer one. This inquiry will be developed within the unified diocesan pastoral care of marriage.

Art. 3. This same inquiry is entrusted to persons deemed suitable by the local ordinary, with the appropriate expertise, though not exclusively juridical-canonical. Among them in the first place is the parochus or the one who prepared the spouses for the wedding celebration. This function of counseling can also be entrusted to other clerics, religious or lay people approved by the local ordinary.

One diocese, or several together, according to the present groupings, can form a stable structure through which to provide this service and, if appropriate, a handbook (vademecum) containing the elements essential to the most appropriate way of conducting the inquiry.

Art. 4. The pastoral inquiry will collect elements useful for the introduction of the case before the competent tribunal either by the spouses or perhaps by their advocates. It is necessary to discover whether the parties are in agreement about petitioning nullity.

Art. 5. Once all the elements have been collected, the inquiry culminates in the libellus, which, if appropriate, is presented to the competent tribunal.

Art. 6. Since the code of canon law must be applied in all matters, without prejudice to special norms, even the matrimonial processes in accord with can.1691, ` 3, the present ratio does not intend to explain in detail a summary of the whole process, but more specifically to illustrate the main legislative changes and, where appropriate, to complete it.

Art. 7 ` 1. The titles of competence in can. 1672 are the same, observing in as much as possible the principle of proximity between the judges and the parties.

` 2. Through the cooperation between tribunals mentioned in can. 1418, care is to be taken that everyone, parties or witnesses, can participate in the process at a minimum of cost.

Art. 8 ` 1. In dioceses which lack their own tribunals, the bishop should take care that, as soon as possible, persons are formed who can zealously assist in setting up marriage tribunals, even by means of courses in well-established and continuous institutions sponsored by the diocese or in cooperation with groupings of dioceses and with the assistance of the Apostolic See.

` 2. The bishop can withdraw from an interdiocesan tribunal constituted in accordance with can. 1423.

Art. 9. If a spouse dies during the process with the case not yet concluded, the instance is suspended until the other spouse or another person, who is interested, insists upon its continuation; in this case, a legitimate interest must be proven.

Art. 10. The judge can admit an oral petition whenever a party is prevented from presenting a libellus: however, the judge himself orders the notary to draw up the act in writing that must be read to the party and approved, which takes the place of the libellus written by the party for all effects of law.

Art. 11 ` 1. The libellus is presented to the diocesan or interdiocesan tribunal which has been chosen according to the norm of can. 1673 ` 2.

` 2. A respondent who remits himself or herself to the justice of the tribunal, or, when properly cited, once more, makes no response, is deemed not to object to the petition.

Art. 12. To achieve the moral certainty required by law, a preponderance of proofs and indications is not sufficient, but it is required that any prudent doubt of making an error, in law or in fact, is excluded, even if the mere possibility of the contrary is not removed.

Art. 13. If a party expressly declares that he or she objects to receiving any notices about the case, that party is held to have renounced of the faculty of receiving a copy of the sentence. In this case, that party may be notified of the dispositive part of the sentence.

Art. 14 ` 1. Among the circumstances of things and persons that can allow a case for nullity of marriage to be handled by means of the briefer process according to cann. 1683-1687, are included, for example: the defect of faith which can generate simulation of consent or error that determines the will; a brief conjugal cohabitation; an abortion procured to avoid procreation; an obstinate persistence in an extraconjugal relationship at the time of the wedding or immediately following it; the deceitful concealment of sterility, or grave contagious illness, or children from a previous relationship, or incarcerations; a cause of marriage completely extraneous to married life, or consisting of the unexpected pregnancy of the woman, physical violence inflicted to extort consent, the defect of the use of reason which is proved by medical documents, etc.

` 2. Among the documents supporting this petition are included all medical records that can clearly render useless the requirement of an ex officio expert.

Art. 15. If the libellus was presented to introduce the ordinary process, but the judicial vicar believes the case may be treated with the briefer process, he is, in the notification of the libellus according to can. 1676, `1, to invite the respondent who has not signed the libellus to make known to the tribunal whether he or she intends to enter and take an interest in the process. As often as is necessary, he invites the party or parties who have signed the libellus to complete it as soon as possible according to the norm of can. 1684.

Art. 16. The judicial vicar can designate himself as an instructor; but to the extent possible, he is to name an instructor from the diocese where the case originated.

Art. 17. In issuing the citation in accordance with can. 1685, the parties are informed that, if possible, they are to make available, at least three days prior to the session for the instruction of the case, those specific points of the matter upon which the parties or the witnesses are to be questioned, unless they are attached to the libellus.

Art. 18. ` 1. The parties and their advocates can be present for the examination of other parties and witnesses unless the instructor, on account of circumstances of things and persons, decides to proceed otherwise.

` 2. The responses of the parties and witnesses are to be rendered in writing by the notary, but in a summary way and only that which refers to the substance of the disputed marriage.

Art. 19. If the case is instructed at an interdiocesan tribunal, the bishop who is to pronounce the sentence is the one of that place according to the competence established in accordance with can. 1672. If there are several, the principle of proximity between the parties and the judge is observed as far as possible.

Art. 20 ` 1. The diocesan bishop determines according to his own prudence the way in which to pronounce the sentence.

` 2. The sentence which is signed by the bishop and certified by the notary, briefly and concisely explains the reasons for the decision and ordinarily the parties are notified within one month of the day of the decision.

Art. 21. The competent diocesan bishop and the judicial vicar are determined in accordance with can. 1672.

PROMULGATION OF THE NEW CODE OF CANON LAW
APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION
Sacrae Disciplinae Leges
To Our Venerable Brothers the Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Deacons and to the
other members of the People of God
JOHN PAUL BISHOP
Servant of the Servants of God
For an Everlasting Memorial
Over the course of time, the Catholic Church has been wont to revise and renew the laws of its
sacred discipline so that, maintaining always fidelity to the Divine Founder, these laws may be
truly in accord with the salvific mission entrusted to the Church. With this sole aim in view, we
today, 25 January 1983, bring to fulfillment the anticipation of the whole Catholic world, and
decree the publication of the revised Code of Canon Law. In doing so, our thoughts turn back to
this same date in 1959, when our predecessor, John XXIII of happy memory, first publicly
announced his personal decision to reform the current body of canonical laws which had been
promulgated on the feast of Pentecost 1917.
This decision to renew the Code was taken with two others, of which that Pontiff spoke on the
same day: they concerned his desire to hold a synod of the diocese of Rome and to convoke an
Ecumenical Council. Even if the former does not have much bearing on the reform of the Code,
the latter on the other hand, namely the Council, is of the greatest importance for our theme and
is closely linked with its substance.
If one asks why John XXIII had clearly perceived the need to reform the current Code, perhaps
the answer is found in the 1917 Code itself. There is however another reason, the principal one,
namely that the reform of the Code of Canon Law was seen to be directly sought and requested
by the Council itself, which had particularly concentrated its attention upon the Church.
As is quite clear, when the first announcement of the revision of the Code was made, the Council
was something totally in the future. Moreover, the acts of its teaching authority, and particularly its
teaching on the Church, were to be developed over the years 1962-65. Nevertheless, one cannot
fail to see that John XXIII's insight was most accurate, and his proposal must rightly be
acknowledged as one which looked well ahead to the good of the Church.
Therefore, the new Code which appears today necessarily required the prior work of the Council
and, although it was announced together with that ecumenical gathering, it follows it in order of
time, since the tasks needed for its preparation could not begin until the Council had ended.
Turning our thoughts today to the beginning of that long journey, that is to 25 January 1959 and
to John XXIII himself, the originator of the review of the Code, we must acknowledge that this
Code drew its origin from one and the same intention, namely the renewal of Christian life. All the
work of the Council drew its norms and its shape principally from that same intention.
If we now turn our attention to the nature of the labors which preceded the promulgation of the
Code and to the manner in which they were performed, especially during the Pontificates of Paul
VI, John Paul I and then up to this present day, it is vital to make quite clear that these labors
were brought to their conclusion in an eminently collegial spirit. This not only relates to the
external composition of the work, but it affects also the very substance of the laws which have
been drawn up.
This mark of collegiality by which the process of this Code's origin was prominently characterized,
is entirely in harmony with the teaching authority and the nature of the Second Vatican Council.
The Code therefore, not only because of its content but because also of its origin, demonstrates
the spirit of this Council in whose documents the Church, the universal sacrament of salvation (cf.
Const. Lumen Gentium, n. 9, 48) is presented as the People of God, and its hierarchical
constitution is shown as founded on the College of Bishops together with its Head.
For this reason therefore, the Bishops and Episcopal Conferences were invited to associate
themselves with the work of preparing the new Code, so that through a task of such length, in as
collegial a manner as possible, little by little the juridical formulae would come to maturity and
would then serve the whole Church. During the whole period of this task, experts also took part,
people endowed with particular academic standing in the areas of theology, history and especially
Canon law, drawn from all parts of the world.
To each and every one of them we express our deepest gratitude today.
We recall, first of all, those Cardinals, now deceased, who headed the preparatory Commission,
Cardinal Pietro Ciriaci who began the work, and Cardinal Pericles Felici who over a period of
several years guided the labors almost to their goal. We think then of the Secretaries of this
Commission, Monsignor, later Cardinal, Giacomo Violardo and Father Raimondo Bidagor SJ,
both of whom lavished their talents of learning and wisdom on their role. Together with them, we
recall the Cardinals, Archbishops and Bishops, and all who were members of this Commission as
well as the Consultors of the individual study groups engaged over these years in that strenuous
task. God has called these to their eternal reward in the meantime. For all of them our suppliant
prayer is raised to God.
With pleasure we also refer to the living: in the first place, to the present Pro-President of the
Commission, our venerable brother Rosalio Castillo Lara, who has worked so outstandingly for so
long in a role of such responsibility. Next, we refer to our beloved son, Monsignor William Onclin,
who has contributed to the successful outcome of the task with assiduous and diligent care. Then
there are others who played an inestimable part in this Commission, in developing and
completing a task of such volume and complexity, whether as Cardinal members, or as officials,
consultors and collaborators in the various study groups or in other roles.
In promulgating this Code today, therefore, we are fully conscious that this act stems from our
pontifical authority itself, and so assumes a primatial nature. Yet we are no less aware that in its
content this Code reflects the collegial solicitude for the Church of all our brothers in the
episcopate. Indeed, by a certain analogy with the Council itself, the Code must be viewed as the
fruit of collegial cooperation, which derives from the combined energies of experienced people
and institutions throughout the whole Church.
A second question arises: what is the Code? For an accurate answer to this question, it is
necessary to remind ourselves of that distant heritage of law contained in the books of the Old
and New Testaments. It is from this, as from its first source, that the whole juridical and legislative
tradition of the Church derives.
For Christ the Lord in no way abolished the bountiful heritage of the law and the prophets which
grew little by little from the history and experience of the People of God in the Old Testament.
Rather he fulfilled it (cf. Matt.5,17), so that it could, in a new and more sublime way, lead to the
heritage of the New Testament. Accordingly, although St Paul in expounding the mystery of
salvation teaches that justification is not obtained through the works of the law but through faith
(cf. Rom.3,28; Gal.2,16), nonetheless he does not exclude the binding force of the Decalogue (cf.
Rom.13,8-10; Gal.5,13-25; 6, 2), nor does he deny the importance of discipline in the Church (cf.
1 Cor.5 and 6). Thus the writings of the New Testament allow us to perceive more clearly the
great importance of this discipline and to understand better the bonds which link it ever more
closely with the salvific character of the Gospel message.
Granted this, it is sufficiently clear that the purpose of the Code is not in any way to replace faith,
grace, charisms and above all charity in the life of the Church or of Christ's faithful. On the
contrary, the Code rather looks towards the achievement of order in the ecclesial society, such
that while attributing a primacy to love, grace and the charisms, it facilitates at the same time an
orderly development in the life both of the ecclesial society and of the individual persons who
belong to it.
As the Church's fundamental legislative document, and because it is based on the juridical and
legislative heritage of revelation and tradition the Code must be regarded as the essential
instrument for the preservation of right order, both in individual and social life and in the Church's
zeal. Therefore, over and above the fundamental elements of the hierarchical and organic
structure of the Church established by the Divine Founder based on apostolic or other no less
ancient tradition, and besides the principal norms which concern the exercise of the threefold
office entrusted to the Church, it is necessary for the Code to define also certain rules and norms
of action.
The instrument, such as the Code is, fully accords with the nature of the Church, particularly as
presented in the authentic teaching of the Second Vatican Council seen as a whole, and
especially in its ecclesiological doctrine. In fact, in a certain sense, this new Code can be viewed
as a great effort to translate the conciliar ecclesiological teaching into canonical terms. If it is
impossible perfectly to transpose the image of the Church described by conciliar doctrine into
canonical language, nevertheless the Code must always be related to that image as to its primary
pattern, whose outlines, given its nature, the Code must express as far as is possible.
Hence flow certain fundamental principles by which the whole of the new Code is governed,
within the limits of its proper subject and of its expression, which must reflect that subject. Indeed
it is possible to assert that from this derives that characteristic whereby the Code is regarded as a
complement to the authentic teaching proposed by the Second Vatican Council and particularly to
its Dogmatic and Pastoral Constitutions.
From this it follows that the fundamental basis of the 'newness' which, while never straying from
the Church's legislative tradition, is found in the Second Vatican Council and especially in its
ecclesiological teaching, generates also the mark of 'newness' in the new Code.
Foremost among the elements which express the true and authentic image of the Church are: the
teaching whereby the Church is presented as the People of God (cf. Const. Lumen Gentium, n. 2)
and its hierarchical authority as service (ibid n. 3); the further teaching which portrays the Church
as a communion and then spells out the mutual relationships which must intervene between the
particular and the universal Church, and between collegiality and primacy; likewise, the teaching
by which all members of the People of God share, each in their own measure, in the threefold
priestly, prophetic and kingly office of Christ, with which teaching is associated also that which
looks to the duties and rights of Christ's faithful and specifically the laity; and lastly the assiduity
which the Church must devote to ecumenism.
If, therefore, the Second Vatican Council drew old and new from the treasury of tradition, and if its
newness is contained in these and other elements, it is abundantly clear that the Code receives
into itself the same mark of fidelity in newness and newness in fidelity, and that its specific
content and corresponding form of expression is in conformity with this aim.
The new Code of Canon Law is published precisely at a time when the Bishops of the whole
Church are not only asking for its promulgation but indeed are insistently and vehemently
demanding it.
And in fact a Code of Canon Law is absolutely necessary for the Church. Since the Church is
established in the form of a social and visible unit, it needs rules, so that its hierarchical and
organic structure may be visible; that its exercise of the functions divinely entrusted to it,
particularly of sacred power and of the administration of the sacraments, is properly ordered; that
the mutual relationships of Christ's faithful are reconciled in justice based on charity, with the
rights of each safeguarded and defined; and lastly, that the common initiatives which are
undertaken so that Christian life may be ever more perfectly carried out, are supported
strengthened and promoted by canonical laws.
Finally, canonical laws by their very nature demand observance. For this reason, the greatest
care has been taken that during the long preparation of the Code there should be an accurate
expression of the norms and that they should depend upon a sound juridical, canonical and
theological foundation.
In view of all this, it is very much to be hoped that the new canonical legislation will be an
effective instrument by the help of which the Church will be able to perfect itself in the spirit of the
Second Vatican Council, and show itself ever more equal to carry out its salvific role in the world.
It is pleasing to set out these reflections of ours in a trusting spirit as we promulgate this principal
body of ecclesiastical laws for the Latin Church.
May God grant that joy and peace, with justice and obedience, may commend this Code, and that
what is bidden by the head will be obeyed in the body.
Relying, therefore, on the help of divine grace, supported by the authority of the Blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul, with certain knowledge and assenting to the pleas of the Bishops of the whole
world who have labored with us in collegial good will, by the supreme authority which is ours, and
by means of this Constitution of ours which is to have effect for the future, we promulgate this
present Code as it has been compiled and reviewed. We order that henceforth it is to have the
force of law for the whole Latin Church, and we commit its observance to the care and vigilance
of all who are responsible. In order, however, that all may properly investigate these prescriptions
and intelligently come to know them before they take effect, we decree and command that they
shall come into force from the first day of Advent of the year 1983, all ordinances, constitutions
and privileges, even those meriting special and individual mention, as well as contrary customs,
notwithstanding.
We, therefore, exhort all our beloved children to observe, with sincere mind and ready will, the
precepts laid down, buoyed up by the hope that a zealous Church discipline will flourish anew,
and that from it the salvation of souls also will be ever more fervently promoted, with the
assistance of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church.
Given at Rome, in the Vatican, on the 25th day of January 1983, in the fifth year of our
Pontificate.
JOHN PAUL II
