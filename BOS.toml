Preface = '''
The Book of Occasional Services is a collection of liturgical resources
related to occasions which do not occur with sufficient frequency to
warrant their inclusion in The Book of Common Prayer. As provided for
in the copyright statement, it is expected that the materials to be used for
a specific occasion will be reproduced locally for that use.
All of the material in this book is optional. None of it is required, and no
congregation is likely to make use of all of it.
The materials included in this collection come from a variety of sources.
Generally, they arise out of the specific use of worshipping communities
engaged in the process of creating liturgical responses to particular
occasions in the life of the church. A previous edition, for example,
included for the first time liturgical forms to accompany the preparation
of adults for baptism.
It is intended that the collection will evolve as the church continues to
discover opportunities to address the life of the Christian community in
liturgy. As the church expresses the need for additional occasional
liturgical materials, and as the General Convention authorizes the use of
those materials, new editions of this book will be prepared and published.
(Each successive printing of the book will bear in the title, the date of the
General Convention to which it responds.)
Every worshipping community in the church has an important role to
play in the ongoing development of this worship resource. The Standing
Liturgical Commission is anxious to hear about the use of the liturgies in
this volume, and welcomes suggestions and examples of additional
liturgical forms to include in future editions.

Anthems at the Candle Lighting
The anthems (Lucernaria) which follow are intended for optional use at
the Order of Worship for the Evening as provided for in the second
rubric on page 112 of the Prayer Book. They are arranged for
responsorial performance by a cantor or reader and the congregation.
All repeat the complete refrain after the cantor, and the second half of
the refrain after the verse which follows. The Lucernarium then
concludes with the first half of the Gloria Patri, followed by the
complete refrain.
The Versicle which follows is sung or said by the officiant or by a cantor.
Any of the Versicles may be used with any of the Lucernaria.
When these anthems are used, it is appropriate to omit the Short Lesson
which precedes the Prayer for Light.

If, instead of one of the preceding anthems, it is desired to sing a
complete psalm at this point in the service, one of the evening psalms
listed on page 143 of the Prayer Book may be used.
Luceraria
Anthems at the Breaking of Bread
One or more anthems may be used at the Breaking of the Bread.
The anthems (Confractoria) which follow are of varying length, and
should be chosen on the basis of the time required for the Breadbreaking (whether of a whole loaf or of a number of large wafers), and
for their seasonal appropriateness.
It should be noted that the rubrics of the Prayer Book require that the
initial breaking of the Bread take place in silence. A distinct period of
silence then follows (the celebrant having replaced the Bread on the
paten). The singing of the Confractorium is then begun, during which
the celebrant and other priests break the Bread for distribution. In the
absence of a sufficient number of priests, deacons may assist in the
Bread-breaking. The pouring of consecrated Wine into any additional
chalices should also take place during this anthem, and before the
Invitation “The Gifts of God . . . ”and the celebrant’s communion.
Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;
Therefore let us keep the feast.
The bread which we break is a sharing in the Body of Christ.
We being many are one bread, one body,
for we all share in the one bread.
Confractoria
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us.
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us.
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
grant us thy peace.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
grant us peace.
My flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,
says the Lord.
My flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,
says the Lord.
Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood dwell in me
and I in them.
My flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,
says the Lord.
Whoever eats this bread will live for ever.
Whoever eats this bread will live for ever.
This is the true bread which comes down from heaven
and gives life to the world.
Whoever eats this bread will live for ever.
Confractoria
Whoever believes in me shall not hunger or thirst,
for the bread which I give for the life of the world
is my flesh.
Whoever eats this bread will live for ever.
Anthems 7 through 10 are not used in the season of Lent.

Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia.

for though many we share one bread.

The following anthems may be used as separate pieces, or as refrains
with selected verses from the psalms. In Easter Season, it is appropriate
to add Alleluia (Hallelujah) to the anthem or refrain.
Blessed are those who are called to the Supper of the Lamb.
Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever
believes in me shall never thirst.
Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me and
I in them.
You shall eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, says the
Lord.
Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep
the feast.

Seasonal Blessings
The following blessings may be used by a bishop or priest whenever a
blessing is appropriate.

The formula for chanting these blessings is given in the musical appendix
to the Altar Edition.

Concerning the Advent Wreath
The Advent Wreath is a visual symbol marking the progress of the season
of Advent. When it used in the church, no special prayers or ceremonial
elaboration beyond what is described on page 143 of the Prayer Book is
desirable. At morning services the appropriate number of candles is
lighted before the service begins.
When used in private homes, the Advent Wreath provides a convenient
focus for devotions at the time of the evening meal. The short form of An
Order of Worship for the Evening, Prayer Book pages 109-112, is
recommended.
In place of the Short Lesson of Scripture provided in the Order, one of
the readings from the Daily Office Lectionary may be used, in whole or
in part. Alternatively, some other plan of Bible reading may be followed.
Phos hilaron is always appropriate but an Advent hymn may be
substituted for it.
Advent Wreath
Advent Festival of Lessons and Music
The following bidding and lessons may be used at a festival held in
Advent.
If the festival takes place in the evening, it may be introduced by the
Service of Light (Prayer Book, page 109). The seasonal Lucernarium
(page 12) or Psalm 85:7-13 may be sung during the candle lighting.
After the Phos hilaron or the hymn sung in place of it, the service
continues with the Bidding Prayer.
A Bidding Prayer Traditional
Beloved in Christ, in this season of Advent, let it be our care
and delight to prepare ourselves to hear again the message of
the Angels, and in heart and mind to go even unto
Bethlehem, to see the Babe lying in a manger.
Let us read and mark in Holy Scripture the tale of the loving
purposes of God from the first days of our disobedience unto
the glorious Redemption brought us by his holy Child; and
let us look forward to the yearly remembrance of his birth
with hymns and songs of praise.
But first, let us pray for the needs of his whole world; for
peace and goodwill over all the earth; for the mission and
Advent Festival
unity of the Church for which he died, and especially in this
country and within this city.
And because this of all things would rejoice his heart, let us
at this time remember in his name the poor and the helpless;
the hungry and the oppressed; the sick and those who
mourn; the lonely and the unloved; the aged and the little
children; and all those who know not the Lord Jesus, or who
love him not, or who by sin have grieved his heart of love.
Lastly, let us remember before God his pure and lowly
Mother, and all those who rejoice with us, but upon another
shore and in a greater light, that multitude which no one can
number, whose hope was in the Word made flesh, and with
whom, in this Lord Jesus, we for evermore are one.
These prayers and praises let us humbly offer up to the
throne of heaven, in the words which Christ himself hath
taught us:
Our Father . . . .
The Almighty God bless us with his grace; Christ give us the
joys of everlasting life; and unto the fellowship of the
citizens above may the King of Angels bring us all. Amen.

the message of the Angels, to go to Bethlehem and see the
Son of God lying in a manger.
Let us hear and heed in Holy Scripture the story of God’s
]loving purpose from the time of our rebellion against him
until the glorious redemption brought to us by his holy
Child Jesus, and let us look forward to the yearly

But first, let us pray for the needs of his whole world, for
peace and justice on earth, for the unity and mission of the

his name the poor and helpless, the cold, the hungry and the
oppressed, the sick and those who mourn, the lonely and
unloved, the aged and little children, as well as all those who
do not know and love the Lord Jesus Christ.

ever and ever. Amen.

may be found worthy, in him, to be clothed with his divinity;
who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.

in every generation.

Baptism of Our Lord
Candlemas Procession
This procession is intended for use immediately before the Holy
Eucharist on the Feast of the Presentation of Our Lord in the Temple.
When circumstances permit, the congregation gathers at a place apart
from the church so that all may go into the church in procession. If
necessary, however, the procession takes place within the church. In this
case it is suitable that the celebrant begin the rite standing just inside the
door of the church.
All are provided with unlighted candles. A server holds the celebrant’s
candle until the procession begins. The congregation stands facing the
celebrant.
The Celebrant greets the people with these words
People
Light and peace, in Jesus Christ our Lord.
Thanks be to God.
The following canticle is then sung or said, during which the candles are
lighted.
A Light to enlighten the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel.
A Light to enlighten the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel.
Candlemas Procession
Lord, you now have set your servant free *
to go in peace as you have promised.
A Light to enlighten the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel.
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *
whom you have prepared for all the world to see.
A Light to enlighten the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel.
The Celebrant then says the following prayer
Let us pray.
God our Father, source of all light, today you revealed to the
aged Simeon your light which enlightens the nations. Fill our
hearts with the light of faith, that we who bear these candles
may walk in the path of goodness, and come to the Light
that shines for ever, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
The Procession
Deacon
People
Let us go forth in peace.
In the name of Christ. Amen.
During the procession, all carry lighted candles; and appropriate hymns,
psalms, or anthems are sung.
At a suitable place, the procession may halt while the following or some
other appropriate Collect is said
Candlemas Procession
Let us pray.
O God, you have made this day holy by the presentation of
your Son in the Temple, and by the purification of the
Blessed Virgin Mary: Mercifully grant that we, who delight in
her humble readiness to be the birth-giver of the Onlybegotten, may rejoice for ever in our adoption as his sisters
and brothers; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
The following antiphon and psalm is appropriate as the procession
approaches the Altar
We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O Lord,
in the midst of your temple. Your praise, like your Name, O
God, reaches to the world’s end; your right hand is full of
justice.
Psalm 48:1-2,10-13
In place of the long antiphon given above, this shorter form may be used
with the appointed Psalm
We have waited on your loving-kindness, O Lord, in the
midst of your temple.
On arrival in the sanctuary, the celebrant goes to the usual place, and the
Eucharist begins with the Gloria in excelsis.
After the Collect of the Day, all extinguish their candles.
If desired, the candles of the congregation may be lighted again at the
time of the dismissal, and borne by them as they leave the church.
Candlemas Procession
Concerning the Service
The devotion known as the Way of the Cross is an adaptation to local
usage of a custom widely observed by pilgrims to Jerusalem: the offering
of prayer at a series of places in that city traditionally associated with
our Lord’s passion and death.
The number of stations, which at first varied widely, finally became fixed
at fourteen. Of these, eight are based directly on events recorded in the
Gospels. The remaining six (numbers 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 13) are based on
inferences from the Gospel account or from pious legend. If desired,
these six stations may be omitted.
The form which follows is appropriate either as a public service or as a
private devotion, particularly on the Fridays of Lent, but it should not
displace the Proper Liturgy of Good Friday.
Traditionally, the stations are made before a series of plain wooden
crosses placed along the walls of the church or in some other convenient
place. With each cross there is sometimes associated a pictorial
representation of the event being commemorated.
The hymn Stabat Mater (“At the cross her station keeping”) has
frequently been associated with this service, but is not an integral part of
it. Selected stanzas of this hymn may appropriately be sung at the
entrance of the ministers, and (after the opening devotions before the
Altar) as the procession approaches the first station.
In the form which follows, the Trisagion (“Holy God”) is the chant
recommended as the procession goes from station to station.
Alternatively, the Trisagion may be used to conclude each station, and
stanzas of appropriate hymns sung as the procession moves. It is
appropriate that all present take part in the procession.
The officiant at the service, whether clerical or lay, customarily leads the
opening versicle at each station and reads the concluding Collect. The
Readings (and the versicles which follow) are appropriately assigned to
other persons.
Way of the Cross

A hymn or other song may be sung during the entrance of the ministers.
Opening Devotions
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. Amen.
Lord, have mercy.
Christ, have mercy.
Lord, have mercy.
Officiant and People
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name,
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your Name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those
who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial,
and deliver us from evil.
Way of the Cross
V. We will glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ:
R. In whom is our salvation, our life and resurrection.
Let us pray.
(Silence)
Assist us mercifully with your help, O Lord God of our
salvation, that we may enter with joy upon the contemplation
of those mighty acts, whereby you have given us life and
immortality; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
The procession goes to the First Station.
Way of the Cross
First Station
Jesus is condemned to death
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
As soon as it was morning, the chief priests, with the elders
and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation; and
they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to
Pilate. And they all condemned him and said, “He deserves
to die.” When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out
and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the
Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. Then he handed
Jesus over to them to be crucified.
V. God did not spare his own Son:
R. But delivered him up for us all.
Let us pray.
(Silence)
Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but
first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he
was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way
of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and
peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Second Station
Jesus takes up his Cross
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
Jesus went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the
place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what
he suffered. Like a lamb he was led to the slaughter; and like
a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so he opened not his
mouth. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power
and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory
and blessing.
V. The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all:
R. For the transgression of my people was he stricken.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Almighty God, whose beloved Son willingly endured the
agony and shame of the cross for our redemption: Give us
courage to take up our cross and follow him; who lives and
reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Third Station
Jesus falls the first time
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God, did not
count equality with God a thing to be grasped; but emptied
himself, taking the form of a servant, and was born in
human likeness. And being found in human form he
humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even
death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him,
and bestowed on him the name which is above every name.
Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, and kneel
before the Lord our Maker, for he is the Lord our God.
V. Surely he has borne our griefs:
R. And carried our sorrows.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many and
great dangers, that by reason of the frailty of our nature we
cannot always stand upright: Grant us such strength and
protection as may support us in all dangers, and carry us
through all temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Fourth Station
Jesus meets his afflicted mother
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
To what can I liken you, to what can I compare you, O
daughter of Jerusalem? What likeness can I use to comfort
you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For vast as the sea is your
ruin. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be
comforted. The Lord will be your everlasting light, and your
days of mourning shall be ended.
V. A sword will pierce your own soul also:
R. And fill your heart with bitter pain.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, who willed that in the passion of your Son a sword
of grief should pierce the soul of the Blessed Virgin Mary his
mother: Mercifully grant that your Church, having shared
with her in his passion, may be made worthy to share in the
joys of his resurrection; who lives and reigns for ever and
ever. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Fifth Station
The Cross is laid on Simon of Cyrene
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
As they led Jesus away, they came upon a man of Cyrene,
Simon by name, who was coming in from the country, and
laid on him the cross to carry it behind Jesus. “If anyone
would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
cross and follow me. Take my yoke upon you, and learn
from me; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
V. Whoever does not bear his own cross and come
after me:
R. Cannot be my disciple.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Heavenly Father, whose blessed Son came not to be served
but to serve: Bless all who, following in his steps, give
themselves to the service of others; that with wisdom,
patience, and courage, they may minister in his Name to the
suffering, the friendless, and the needy; for the love of him
who laid down his life for us, your Son our Savior Jesus
Christ. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Sixth Station
A woman wipes the face of Jesus
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
We have seen him without beauty or majesty, with no looks
to attract our eyes. He was despised and rejected by men; a
man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from
whom men hide their faces, he was despised, and we
esteemed him not. His appearance was so marred, beyond
human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children
of men. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement
that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed.
V. Restore us, O Lord God of hosts:
R. Show the light of your countenance, and we shall
be saved.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, who before the passion of your only-begotten Son
revealed his glory upon the holy mountain: Grant to us that
we, beholding by faith the light of his countenance, may be
strengthened to bear our cross, and be changed into his
likeness from glory to glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Seventh Station
Jesus falls a second time
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. All
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened
not his mouth. For the transgression of my people was he
stricken.
V. But as for me, I am a worm and no man:
R. Scorned by all and despised by the people.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Almighty and everliving God, in your tender love for the
human race you sent your Son our Savior Jesus Christ to
take upon him our nature, and to suffer death upon the
cross, giving us the example of his great humility: Mercifully
grant that we may walk in the way of his suffering, and also
share in his resurrection; who lives and reigns for ever and
ever. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Eighth Station
Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
There followed after Jesus a great multitude of the people,
and among them were women who bewailed and lamented
him. But Jesus turning to them said, “Daughters of
Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and
for your children.”
V. Those who sowed with tears:
R. Will reap with songs of joy.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Teach your Church, O Lord, to mourn the sins of which it is
guilty, and to repent and forsake them; that, by your
pardoning grace, the results of our iniquities may not be
visited upon our children and our children’s children;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Ninth Station
Jesus falls a third time
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his
wrath; he has driven and brought me into darkness without
any light. He has besieged me and enveloped me with
bitterness and tribulation; he has made me dwell in darkness
like the dead of long ago. Though I call and cry for help, he
shuts out my prayer. He has made my teeth grind on gravel,
and made me cower in ashes. “Remember, O Lord, my
affliction and bitterness, the wormwood and the gall!”
V. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter:
R. And like a sheep that before its shearers is mute,
so he opened not his mouth.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, by the passion of your blessed Son you made an
instrument of shameful death to be for us the means of life:
Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may
gladly suffer shame and loss for the sake of your Son our
Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Tenth Station
Jesus is stripped of his garments
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means
the place of a skull), they offered him wine to drink, mingled
with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And
they divided his garments among them by casting lots. This
was to fulfill the scripture which says, “They divided my
garments among them; they cast lots for my clothing.”
V. They gave me gall to eat:
R. And when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Lord God, whose blessed Son our Savior gave his body to be
whipped and his face to be spit upon: Give us grace to accept
joyfully the sufferings of the present time, confident of the
glory that shall be revealed; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Eleventh Station
Jesus is nailed to the Cross
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
When they came to the place which is called The Skull, there
they crucified him; and with him they crucified two
criminals, one on the right, the other on the left, and Jesus
between them. And the scripture was fulfilled which says,
“He was numbered with the transgressors.”
V. They pierce my hands and my feet:
R. They stare and gloat over me.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on
the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within
the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit
that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those
who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for
the honor of your Name. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Twelfth Station
Jesus dies on the Cross
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved
standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your
son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!”
And when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, “It is
finished!” And then, crying with a loud voice, he said,
“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” And he
bowed his head, and handed over his spirit.
V. Christ for us became obedient unto death:
R. Even death on a cross.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, who for our redemption gave your only-begotten
Son to the death of the cross, and by his glorious
resurrection delivered us from the power of our enemy:
Grant us so to die daily to sin, that we may evermore live
with him in the joy of his resurrection; who lives and reigns
now and for ever. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Thirteenth Station
The body of Jesus is placed in the arms of his mother
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
All you who pass by, behold and see if there is any sorrow
like my sorrow. My eyes are spent with weeping; my soul is
in tumult; my heart is poured out in grief because of the
downfall of my people. “Do not call me Naomi (which
means Pleasant), call me Mara (which means Bitter); for the
Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.”
V. Her tears run down her cheeks:
R. And she has none to comfort her.
Let us pray. (Silence)
Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away the sting of
death: Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where
you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep
peacefully in you and wake up in your likeness; for your
tender mercies’ sake. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.
Way of the Cross
Fourteenth Station
Jesus is laid in the tomb
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you:
Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
When it was evening, there came a rich man from
Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of
Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took
the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and laid it
in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and
he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb.
V. You will not abandon me to the grave:
R. Nor let your holy One see corruption.
Let us pray. (Silence)
O God, your blessed Son was laid in a tomb in a garden, and
rested on the Sabbath day: Grant that we who have been
buried with him in the waters of baptism may find our
perfect rest in his eternal and glorious kingdom; where he
lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
Have mercy upon us.

Concluding Prayers before the Altar
Savior of the world, by your cross and precious blood you
have redeemed us:
Save us, and help us, we humbly beseech you, O Lord.
Let us pray. (Silence)
We thank you, heavenly Father, that you have delivered us
from the dominion of sin and death and brought us into the
kingdom of your Son; and we pray that, as by his death he
has recalled us to life, so by his love he may raise us to
eternal joys; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.
To Christ our Lord who loves us, and washed us in his own
blood, and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God
and Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen.

Concerning the Service
The name Tenebrae (the Latin word for “darkness” or “shadows”) has
for centuries been applied to the ancient monastic night and early
morning services (Matins and Lauds) of the last three days of Holy
Week, which in medieval times came to be celebrated on the preceding
evenings.
Apart from the chant of the Lamentations (in which each verse is
introduced by a letter of the Hebrew alphabet), the most conspicuous
feature of the service is the gradual extinguishing of candles and other
lights in the church until only a single candle, considered a symbol of our
Lord, remains. Toward the end of the service this candle is hidden,
typifying the apparent victory of the forces of evil. At the very end, a
loud noise is made, symbolizing the earthquake at the time of the
resurrection (Matthew 28:2), the hidden candle is restored to its place,
and by its light all depart in silence.
In this book, provision is made for Tenebrae on Wednesday evening only,
in order that the proper liturgies of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday
may find their place as the principal services of those days. By drawing
upon material from each of the former three offices of Tenebrae, this
service provides an extended meditation upon, and a prelude to, the
events in our Lord’s life between the Last Supper and the Resurrection.
Additional Directions are on page 91.

Lesson 1
A Reading from the Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet.
[1:1-14]
Aleph. How solitary lies the city, once so full of people! How
like a widow has she become, she that was great among the
nations! She that was queen among the cities has now
become a vassal.
Beth. She weeps bitterly in the night, tears run down her
cheeks; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her; all
become her enemies.
Gimel. Judah has gone into the misery of exile and of hard
servitude; she dwells now among the nations, but finds no
resting place; all her pursuers overtook her in the midst of
her anguish.
Daleth. The roads to Zion mourn, because none come to the
solemn feasts; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan
and sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
He. Her adversaries have become her masters, her enemies
prosper; because the Lord has punished her for the
multitude of her rebellions; her children are gone, driven
away as captives by the enemy.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord your God!
Tenebrae
Responsory 1
In monte Oliveti
On the mount of Olives Jesus prayed to the Father:
Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
V. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Lesson 2
Waw. And from Daughter Zion all her majesty has departed;
her princes have become like stags that can find no pasture,
and that run without strength before the hunter.
Zayin. Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and
bitterness all the precious things that were hers from the
days of old; when her people fell into the hand of the foe,
and there was none to help her; the adversary saw her, and
mocked at her downfall.
Heth. Jerusalem has sinned greatly, therefore she has become
a thing unclean; all who honored her despise her, for they
have seen her nakedness; and now she sighs, and turns her
face away.
Teth. Uncleanness clung to her skirts, she took no thought of
her doom; therefore her fall is terrible, she has no comforter.
“O Lord, behold my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed.”
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord your God!
Responsory 2 Tristis est anima mea
My soul is very sorrowful, even to the point of death;
remain here, and watch with me.
Tenebrae
Now you shall see the crowd who will surround me;
you will flee, and I will go to be offered up for you.
V. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man
is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
You will flee, and I will go to be offered up for you
Lesson 3
Yodh. The adversary has stretched out his hand to seize all
her precious things; she has seen the Gentiles invade her
sanctuary, those whom you had forbidden to enter your
congregation.
Kaph. All her people groan as they search for bread; they sell
their own children for food to revive their strength. “Behold,
O Lord, and consider, for I am now beneath contempt!”
Lamedh. Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold
and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was
brought upon me, which the Lord inflicted, on the day of his
burning anger.
Mem. From on high he sent fire, into my bones it descended;
he spread a net for my feet, and turned me back; he has left
me desolate and faint all the day long.
Nun. My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his
hand they were fastened together; their yoke is upon my
neck; he has caused my strength to fail. The Lord has
delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to
stand up.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord your God!
Tenebrae
Responsory 3 Ecce vidimus eum
Lo, we have seen him without beauty or majesty,
with no looks to attract our eyes.
He bore our sins and grieved for us,
he was wounded for our transgressions,
and by his scourging we are healed.
V. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows:
And by his scourging we are healed.
When this Responsory is sung rather than recited, repeat all that
precedes the Verse:
Lo, we have seen . . . we are healed.
Second Nocturn
Antiphon 4
The kings of the earth rise up in revolt, and the princes plot
together, against the Lord and against his Anointed.
Psalm 2
Antiphon 5
They divide my garments among them; they cast lots for my
clothing.

Antiphon 6
False witnesses have risen up against me, and also those who
speak malice.
Psalm 27
Tenebrae
V. They divide my garments among them:
R. They cast lots for my clothing.
All stand for silent prayer. The appointed Reader then goes to the
lectern, and everyone else sits down.
Lesson 4
A Reading from the Treatise of Saint Augustine the Bishop on
the Psalms. [Vulgate Psalm 54. Prayer Book Psalm 55:1,2,10c]
Hear my prayer, O God; do not hide yourself from my
petition. Listen to me and answer me. I mourn in my trial
and am troubled.”
These are the words of one disquieted, in trouble and
anxiety. He prays under much suffering, desiring to be
delivered from evil. Let us now see under what evil he lies;
and when he begins to speak, let us place ourselves beside
him, that, by sharing his tribulation, we may also join in his
prayer.
“I mourn in my trial,” he says, “and am troubled.”
When does he mourn? When is he troubled? He says, “In my
trial.” He has in mind the wicked who cause him suffering,
and he calls this suffering his “trial.” Do not think that the
evil are in the world for no purpose, and that God makes no
good use of them. Every wicked person lives either that he
may be corrected, or that through him the righteous may be
tried and tested.
Responsory 4
Tamquam ad latronem
Have you come out as against a robber,
with swords and clubs to capture me?
Tenebrae
Day after day I sat in the temple teaching,
and you did not seize me;
but now, behold, you scourge me,
and lead me away to be crucified.
V. When they had laid hands on Jesus and were holding
him, he said:
Day after day I sat in the temple teaching,
and you did not seize me;
but now, behold, you scourge me,
and lead me away to be crucified.
Lesson 5
Would that those who now test us were converted and tried
with us; yet though they continue to try us, let us not hate
them, for we do not know whether any of them will persist
to the end in their evil ways. And most of the time, when you
think you are hating your enemy, you are hating your
brother without knowing it.
Only the devil and his angels are shown to us in the Holy
Scriptures as doomed to eternal fire. It is only their
amendment that is hopeless, and against them we wage a
hidden battle. For this battle the Apostle arms us, saying,
“We are not contending against flesh and blood,” that is, not
against human beings whom we see, “but against the
principalities, against the powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world.” So that you may not think that
demons are the rulers of heaven and earth, he says, “of the
darkness of this world.”
He says, “of the world,” meaning the lovers of the world––
of the “world,” meaning the ungodly and wicked––
the “world” of which the Gospel says, “And the world
knew him not.”
Tenebrae
Responsory 5
Tenebrae factae sunt
Darkness covered the whole land
when Jesus had been crucified;
and about the ninth hour he cried with a loud voice:
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
And he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.
V. Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said:
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.
And he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.
Lesson 6
“For I have seen unrighteousness and strife in the city.”
See the glory of the cross itself. On the brow of kings that
cross is now placed, the cross which enemies once mocked.
Its power is shown in the result. He has conquered the
world, not by steel, but by wood. The wood of the cross
seemed a fitting object of scorn to his enemies, and standing
before that wood they wagged their heads, saying, “If you
are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” He
stretched out his hands to an unbelieving and rebellious
people. If one is just who lives by faith, one who does not
have faith is unrighteous. Therefore when he says
“unrighteousness,” understand that it is unbelief. The Lord
then saw unrighteousness and strife in the city, and stretched
out his hands to an unbelieving and rebellious people. And
yet, looking upon them, he said, “Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do.”
Responsory 6
Ecce quomodo moritur
See how the righteous one perishes,
and no one takes it to heart.
Tenebrae
The righteous are taken away, and no one understands.
From the face of evil the righteous one is taken away,
and his memory shall be in peace.
V. Like a sheep before its shearers is mute, so he opened
not his mouth.By oppression and judgment he was
taken away:
And his memory shall be in peace.
When this Responsory is sung rather than recited, repeat all that precedes the
Verse:
See how the righteous . . . in peace.

V. He has made me dwell in darkness:
R. Like the dead of long ago.

All stand for silent prayer. The appointed Reader then goes to the
lectern, and everyone else sits down.
Lesson 7
A Reading from the Letter to the Hebrews.
[4:15––5:10; 9:11-15a]
We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been
tempted as we are, yet without sinning. Let us then with
confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may
receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For
every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act
on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and
sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and
wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because
of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well
as for those of the people.
Responsory 7
Eram quasi agnus
I was like a trusting lamb led to the slaughter.
I did not know it was against me
that they devised schemes, saying,
Let us destroy the tree with its fruit;
let us cut him off from the land of the living.
V. All my enemies whispered together against me,
and devised evil against me, saying:
Let us destroy the tree with its fruit;
let us cut him off from the land of the living.
Tenebrae
Lesson 8
And one does not take the honor upon himself, but he is
called by God, just as Aaron was. So also, Christ did not
exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by
him who said to him, “You are my Son, this day have I
begotten you;” as he says also in another place, “You are a
priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” In the days of
his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with
loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from
death, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although he was
a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and,
being made perfect, he became the source of eternal
salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a
high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
Responsory 8
Velum templi
The veil of the temple was torn in two,
and the earth shook, and the thief from the cross cried out,
Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
V. The rocks were split, the tombs were opened,
and many bodies of the saints who slept were raised:
And the earth shook, and the thief from the cross cried out,
Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
Lesson 9
But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things
that are to come, then, through the greater and more perfect
tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he
entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood
of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an
Tenebrae
eternal redemption. For if the sprinkling of defiled persons
with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a
heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how much
more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your
conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that
those who are called may receive the promised eternal
inheritance.

The Song of Hezekiah [Isaiah 38:10-20]
In my despair I said,
“In the noonday of my life I must depart; *
my unspent years are summoned to the portals of death.”
And I said,
“No more shall I see the Lord in the land of the living, *
never more look on my kind among dwellers on earth.
My house is pulled down and I am uncovered, *
as when a shepherd strikes his tent.
My life is rolled up like a bolt of cloth, *
the threads cut off from the loom.
Between sunrise and sunset my life is brought to an end; *
I cower and hope for the dawn.
Like a lion he has crushed all my bones; *
like a swallow or thrush I utter plaintive cries;
I mourn like a dove.
Tenebrae
My weary eyes look up to you; *
Lord, be my refuge in my affliction.”
But what can I say? for he has spoken; *

Slow and halting are my steps all my days, *
because of the bitterness of my spirit.
O Lord, I recounted all these things to you
and you rescued me; *
when entreated, you restored my life.
I know now that my bitterness was for my good, *
for you held me back from the pit of destruction,
you cast all my sins behind you.
The grave does not thank you nor death give you praise; *
nor do those at the brink of the grave hang on your promises.
It is the living, O Lord,
the living who give you thanks as I do this day; *
You, Lord, are my Savior; *
I will praise you with stringed instruments
all the days of my life, in the house of the Lord.

Nothing further is said; but a noise is made, and the remaining
candle is brought from its hiding place and replaced on the
stand.
By its light the ministers and people depart in silence.
Tenebrae
Additional Directions
This book provides for the full ancient form of the service: Matins,
subdivided into three Nocturns, and Lauds. If desired, the service may be
shortened somewhat by using the shorter form indicated for certain of
the Psalms. The first two responsories of each Nocturn may also be
omitted.
In preparation for the service, a large triangular candlestick with fifteen
candles is placed at the liturgical south side of the sanctuary. One candle
is extinguished at the end of each Psalm, and at the end of the Song of
Hezekiah. Finally, during the singing of the canticle Benedictus, the
candles at the Altar, and all other lights (except the one at the top of the
triangular stand), are extinguished.
There should be no musical prelude or postlude at this service, nor
should a processional cross or torches be carried, or hymns sung, or
sermons preached.
The ministers, servers, and choir vest in the manner customary for choir
offices. The officiant may wear a tippet over the surplice.
The appointed antiphons are sung or recited in full before and after each
Psalm. The Psalms themselves are sung or recited antiphonally. Gloria
Patri is not used at this service.
Each group of lessons is announced only at the beginning, as indicated in
the text. The usual concluding formula is omitted.
The successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, prefixed to the verses of
the readings from Lamentations, are an integral part of the traditional
chant, and should not be omitted when these lessons are sung. (In the
Hebrew original, each verse begins with the letter indicated.)
If the responsories after the lessons are recited rather than sung, the
congregation reads the parts in italics. In musical settings the
responsories may be sung in full by the choir or by all; the verse [V.] may
be sung by a solo voice. The repetition of the first part of the text in
Responsories 3, 6, and 9 is intended for use in musical settings only.
Tenebrae
If a much shorter form of the service is desired, Nocturns 2 and 3 and the
second or third Psalm of Lauds (Psalm 90 or 143) may be omitted. In
this case two candles are extinguished after each Psalm. Alternatively,
Nocturns 2 and 3 and two of the Lauds’ Psalms may be omitted, and a
seven-branched candlestick used.
Tenebrae
On Maundy Thursday
At the Foot-Washing
If it is desired to introduce the ceremony of foot-washing by a brief
address, the following may be used.
Fellow servants of our Lord Jesus Christ: On the night
before his death, Jesus set an example for his disciples by
washing their feet, an act of humble service. He taught that
strength and growth in the life of the Kingdom of God come
not by power, authority, or even miracle, but by such lowly
service. We all need to remember his example, but none
stand more in need of this reminder than those whom the
Lord has called to the ordained ministry.
Therefore, I invite you [who have been appointed as
representatives of the congregation and] who share in the
royal priesthood of Christ, to come forward, that I may
recall whose servant I am by following the example of my
Master. But come remembering his admonition that what
will be done for you is also to be done by you to others, for
“a servant is not greater than his master, nor is one who is
sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know these
things, blessed are you if you do them.”
Maundy Thursday
On Reserving the Sacrament
When the Sacrament is to be reserved for administration on Good
Friday, it should be kept in a separate chapel or other place apart from
the main sanctuary of the church, in order that on Good Friday the
attention of the congregation may be on the bare main Altar.
On the Stripping of the Altar
If the custom of stripping the Altar is observed as a public ceremony, it
takes place after the Maundy Thursday liturgy. It may be done in silence;
or it may be accompanied by the recitation of Psalm 22, which is said
without Gloria Patri. The following antiphon may be said before and
after the Psalm.
They divide my garments among them; they cast lots for my
clothing.
Maundy Thursday
Agapé for Maundy Thursday
The celebration of festal meals is not appropriate during Holy Week. In
Christian tradition such festivities take place only after the Lenten fast
has been completed by the celebration of the Great Vigil –– which is the
Passover Feast of Christians –– and the reception of Easter Communion.
If it is desired to share a meal after the Maundy Thursday Eucharist, the
following order may be observed.
A meatless meal is to be preferred. The setting should be austere and the
foods sparse and simple. Appropriate foods include soup, cheese, olives,
dried fruit, bread, and wine. It is suitable that the bread and wine for the
meal be brought to the Altar at the time of the Offertory (along with
special offerings for the hungry), and after the service taken to the room
where the meal is to take place.
The following blessings are recited by the Celebrant at the beginning of
the meal, all standing.
Over Wine
Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe. You
create the fruit of the vine; and on this night you have
refreshed us with the cup of salvation in the Blood of your
Son Jesus Christ. Glory to you for ever and ever. Amen.
Maundy Thursday Agapé
Over Bread
Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe. You
bring forth bread from the earth; and on this night you have
given us the bread of life in the Body of your Son Jesus
Christ. As grain scattered upon the earth is gathered into one
loaf, so gather your Church in every place into the kingdom
of your Son. To you be glory and power for ever and ever.
Amen.
Over the Other Foods
Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe. You
have blessed the earth to bring forth food to satisfy our
hunger. Let this food strengthen us in the fast that is before
us, that following our Savior in the way of the cross, we may
come to the joy of his resurrection. For yours is the kingdom
and the power and the glory, now and for ever. Amen.
During the meal or toward its close, a person appointed reads the
seventeenth chapter of the Gospel according to John.
The agapé concludes with a psalm, such as Psalm 69:1-23, or with a
song, or with a prayer, or with a blessing or dismissal.
If an agapé is held, the ceremony of stripping the Altar is deferred until
after the meal.
The form for the agapé given above may also be used in private homes
on this night.
Maundy Thursday Agapé
Blessings Over Food at Easter
These blessings are appropriate for use by households at the principal
meal on Easter Day. They may be used at a parish meal following the
Easter Vigil. They may also be used over foods brought to the church for
blessing.
Over Wine
Blessed are you, O Lord our God, creator of the fruit of the
vine: Grant that we who share this wine, which gladdens our
hearts, may share for ever the new life of the true Vine, your
Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Over Bread
Blessed are you, O Lord our God; you bring forth bread
from the earth and make the risen Lord to be for us the
Bread of life: Grant that we who daily seek the bread which
sustains our bodies may also hunger for the food of
everlasting life, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Easter Food Blessings
Over Lamb
Stir up our memory, O Lord, as we eat this Easter lamb that,
remembering Israel of old, who in obedience to your
command ate the Paschal lamb and was delivered from the
bondage of slavery, we, your new Israel, may rejoice in the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, the true Lamb who has
delivered us from the bondage of sin and death, and who
lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
Over Eggs
O Lord our God, in celebration of the Paschal feast we have
prepared these eggs from your creation: Grant that they may
be to us a sign of the new life and immortality promised to
those who follow your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Over Other Foods
Blessed are you, O Lord our God; you have given us the
risen Savior to be the Shepherd of your people: Lead us, by
him, to springs of living waters, and feed us with the food
that endures to eternal life; where with you, O Father, and
with the Holy Spirit, he lives and reigns, one God, for ever
and ever. Amen.
Easter Food Blessings
Blessing in Homes at Easter
Where it is customary to invite the parish priest to the homes of
parishioners during the Fifty Days of Easter, this blessing may be used.
The Celebrant begins with the following or some other greeting.
Peace be to this house, and to all who dwell in it.
Psalm 114 is then sung or said with one of the following antiphons:
Alleluia. The Lord is risen indeed: Come let us adore him.
Alleluia.
or this
I saw water proceeding out of the temple; from the right side
it flowed, alleluia; and all those to whom that water came
shall be saved, and shall say, alleluia, alleluia.
When Israel came out of Egypt, *
the house of Jacob from a people of strange speech,
Judah became God’s sanctuary *
and Israel his dominion.
The sea beheld it and fled; *
Jordan turned and went back.
The mountains skipped like rams, *
and the little hills like young sheep.
Blessing at Easter
What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? *
O Jordan, that you turned back?
You mountains, that you skipped like rams? *
you little hills like young sheep?
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, *
at the presence of the God of Jacob,
Who turned the hard rock into a pool of water *
and flint-stone into a flowing spring.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.
The antiphon is then repeated.
Another psalm, such as Psalm 118, may be used in place of Psalm 114,
or a canticle may be substituted. Suitable canticles are Christ our
Passover, the Song of Moses, and the Song to the Lamb.
Celebrant
People
Celebrant
The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
Let us pray.
The Celebrant says one of the following Collects, or some other Collect
of the Easter Season.
Grant, we pray, Almighty God, that we who celebrate with
awe the Paschal feast may be found worthy to attain to
everlasting joys; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and
for ever. Amen.
or this
Almighty and everlasting God, who in the Paschal mystery
established the new covenant of reconciliation: Grant that
all who have been reborn into the fellowship of Christ’s
Body may show forth in their lives what they profess by their
Blessing at Easter
faith; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
Amen.
The Celebrant then says this prayer
Visit, O blessed Lord, this home with the gladness of your
presence. Bless all who live here with the gift of your love;
and grant that they may manifest your love [to each other
and] to all whose lives they touch. May they grow in grace
and in the knowledge and love of you; guide, comfort, and
strengthen them; and preserve them in peace, O Jesus
Christ, now and for ever. Amen.
The Celebrant may say one of the two following blessings:
May God the Father, who by Baptism adopts us as his
children, grant you grace. Amen.
May God the Son, who sanctified a home at Nazareth, fill
you with love. Amen.
May God the Holy Spirit, who has made the Church one
family, keep you in peace. Amen.
or this
May Almighty God, who has redeemed us and made us his
children through the resurrection of his Son our Lord, bestow
upon you the riches of his blessing. Amen.
May God, who through the water of baptism has raised us
from sin into newness of life, make you holy and worthy to
be united with Christ for ever. Amen.
May God, who has brought us out of bondage to sin into
true and lasting freedom in the Redeemer, bring you to your
eternal inheritance. Amen.
Blessing at Easter
And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, be upon you and remain with you for ever.
Amen.
The Peace may then be exchanged.
Blessing at Easter
Rogation Procession
The Rogation Days are traditionally observed on the Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday before Ascension Day. They may, however, be observed
on other days, depending on local conditions and the convenience of the
congregation.
Anciently, the observance consisted of an outdoor procession which
culminated in a special celebration of the Eucharist. In more recent
centuries, the procession has frequently taken place on a Sunday
afternoon, apart from the Eucharist.
If the Rogation Procession is held on a Sunday or Principal Feast, it
should take place apart from or following the Proper Eucharist of the
Day. Under these conditions the procession concludes with a suitable
prayer and a blessing.
Hymns, psalms, canticles, and anthems are sung during the procession.
The following are appropriate:
Canticle 1 or 12 (Benedicite)
Psalm 103 (Refrain: “Bless the Lord, O my soul”)
Psalm 104 (Refrain: “Hallelujah”).
At suitable places the procession may halt for appropriate Bible readings
and prayers.
Rogation Procession
In addition to the readings listed on page 930 of the Prayer Book, any of
the following passages are appropriate:
Genesis 8:13-23
Leviticus 26:1-13(14-20)
Deuteronomy 8:1-10(11-20)
Hosea 2:18-23
Ezekiel 34:25-31
James 4:7-11
Matthew 6:25-34
John 12:23-26
Suitable prayers include the following:Prayers 1, 29, 34, 38, 40-44, and
Thanksgivings 1, 8, 9 from the section “Prayers and Thanksgivings” in
the Prayer Book. Also, the following
Almighty and everlasting God, Creator of all things and
giver of all life, let your blessing be upon this (seed,
livestock, plough, forest, __________) and grant that it may
serve to your glory and the welfare of your people; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Customarily, the Great Litany is begun as the procession enters the
church. The following petitions may be inserted following the third
petition on page 151 of the Prayer Book:
That it may please thee to grant favorable weather,
temperate rain, and fruitful seasons, that there may be food
and drink for all thy creatures,
We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.
That it may please thee to bless the lands and waters, and all
who work upon them to bring forth food and all things
needful for thy people,
We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.
That it may please thee to look with favor upon all who care
for the earth, the water, and the air, that the riches of thy
creation may abound from age to age,
We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.
At the conclusion of the Litany, after the Kyries, the Eucharist begins
with the Salutation and one of the Proper Collects for Rogation Days.
Rogation Procession
If the procession cannot take place out of doors, the service may begin
with the Great Litany, which may be sung in procession in the church.
If the Liturgy does not begin with the Great Litany, it is suggested that
Form V be used for the Prayers of the People, and that the following
petitions be added after the eighth petition on page 390:
For favorable weather, temperate rains, and fruitful seasons,
that there may be food and drink for all your creatures, we
pray to you, O Lord.
For your blessing upon the lands and waters, and all who
work upon them to bring forth food and all things needful
for your people, we pray to you, O Lord.
For all who care for the earth, the water, and the air, that the
riches of your creation may abound from age to age, we pray
to you, O Lord.

country where your saints for ever sing your praise; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Pastoral Services
Welcoming New People
To a Congregation
If it is desired to welcome new people to the congregation publicly, it is
suitable that they be introduced in the following manner.
Immediately before the Peace, the persons are asked to come forward,
and are introduced briefly, preferably by a member of the congregation.
The celebrant then begins the exchange of the Peace, in the course of
which those who have been introduced are greeted personally by the
celebrant and members of the congregation as convenient.
Welcoming New People
When Members
Leave a Congregation
When persons leave a congregation, it is suitable that, on their last
Sunday, the fact be mentioned before the Prayers of the People, and that
they be prayed for by name in those Prayers.
They are greeted personally by the celebrant and lay officials of the
congregation at the time of the Peace, or at the end of the service.
When Members Leave
Concerning the Catechumenate
The catechumenate is a period of training and instruction in Christian
understandings about God, human relationships, and the meaning of
life, which culminates in the reception of the Sacraments of Christian
Initiation.
The systematic instruction and formation of its catechumens is a solemn
responsibility of the Christian community. Traditionally, the preparation
of catechumens is a responsibility of the bishop, which is shared with the
presbyters, deacons, and appointed lay catechists of the diocese.
Principles of Implementation
1. A catechumen is defined as an unbaptized adult. These rites are
appropriate for use only with such persons.
2. During the period of the catechumenate, the context of catechesis is a
continual reflection on Scripture, Christian prayer, worship, and the
catechumen’s gifts for ministry and work for justice and peace. These
elements are more or less a part of each catechetical session.
3. The principal curriculum for each catechetical session is reflection on
the respective readings of the Sunday Eucharistic Lectionary as these
illumine the faith journey of catechumens, sponsors, and catechists.
4. The catechetical methodology of the catechumenal and baptismal
rites is: experience first, then reflect. As the catechumen journeys from
inquiry to baptism, there is formation of an ability to discern God’s
activity in the events of one’s life. It is recommended that the services not
be discussed prior to their celebration. It is appropriate that sponsors be
well prepared for their ministry in the respective services and to guide
and support their catechumen during the celebration.
5. The catechumenate exists throughout the year in the parish, and
persons may enter at any time. The catechumenate is of undetermined
length for each catechumen. The appropriate time for the call to
Candidacy for Baptism is discerned by sponsors, catechists, and clergy on
behalf of the local congregation. Baptism of catechumens is normally
reserved for the Great Vigil of Easter.
Catechumenate
6. Since the catechumenate is ecclesial formation for the ministry of the
baptized, it is appropriate that the catechists be representative of the
diversity of the local congregation.
7. It is appropriate for those catechumens baptized at the Great Vigil of
Easter to join the ministry of sponsor or catechist for new catechumens at
the conclusion of the Great Fifty Days.
The Catechumenate is marked by three stages.
Stage 1. The Pre-catechumenal Period. To this stage belong inquirers’
classes with sufficient preparation to enable persons to determine that
they wish to become Christians. It is a time during which those who have
been initially attracted to the Christian community are guided to
examine and test their motives, in order that they may freely commit
themselves to pursue a disciplined exploration of the implications of
Christian living.
Stage 2. The Catechumenate. Entry into the catechumenate is by a public
liturgical act (which may take place for individuals or groups at any
time) at the principal Sunday liturgy. Normatively, the act includes
signing with the cross. To this stage belong regular association with the
worshiping community, the practice of life in accordance with the Gospel
(including service to the poor and neglected), encouragement and
instruction in thelife of prayer, and basic instruction in the history of
salvation as revealed in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments. This stage will vary in length according to the needs of the
individual. For those persons who, although unbaptized, already possess
an understanding and appreciation of the Christian religion, it might be
relatively short.
Each person to be admitted a catechumen is presented by a sponsor who
normally accompanies the catechumen through the process of candidacy
and serves as sponsor at Holy Baptism.
Admission to the catechumenate is an appropriate time to determine the
name by which one desires to be known in the Christian community.
This may be one’s given name, a new name legally changed, or an
additional name of Christian significance.
From the time of admission, a catechumen is regarded as a part of the
Catechumenate
Christian community. For example, a person who dies during the
catechumenate receives a Christian burial.
Stage 3. Candidacy for Baptism. To this stage belong a series of liturgical
acts leading up to baptism. These ordinarily take place on a series of
Sundays preceding one of the stated days for baptism, and involve public
prayer for the candidates, who are present at the services as a group,
accompanied by their sponsors. When the Sacrament of Holy Baptism is
administered at Easter, enrollment as a candidate normally takes place at
the beginning of Lent; when baptisms are planned for the Feast of the
Baptism of Our Lord, the enrollment takes place at the beginning of
Advent.
In addition to these public acts, this stage involves the private disciplines
of fasting, examination of conscience, and prayer, in order that the
candidates will be spiritually and emotionally ready for baptism. It is
appropriate that, in accordance with ancient custom, the sponsors
support their candidates by joining them in prayer and fasting.
A fourth period immediately follows the administration of Holy
Baptism. In the case of persons baptized at the Great Vigil, it extends
over the Fifty Days of Easter. This period is devoted to such activities,
formal and informal, as will assist the newly baptized to experience the
fullness of the corporate life of the Church and to gain a deeper
understanding of the meaning of the Sacraments.
The bishop, the bishop’s representative, or the rector (or priest-in-charge)
of the congregation should preside at the rites of Admission and
Enrollment.
It should be noted that the rites and prayers which follow are
appropriate for use only with persons preparing for baptism. Validly
baptized Christians present at instruction classes to deepen their
understanding of the faith, including members of other Christian bodies
preparing to be received into the Episcopal Church, are under no
circumstances to be considered catechumens. The same is true of persons
preparing to re-affirm their baptismal vows after having abandoned the
practice of the Christian religion, since “The bond which God establishes
in Baptism is indissoluble” (Prayer Book, page 298).
Catechumenate
Preparation of Adults
for Holy Baptism:
The Catechumenate
Admission of Catechumens
The admission of catechumens may take place at any time of the year,
within a principal Sunday liturgy.
After the sermon (or after the Creed) the Celebrant invites those to be
admitted as catechumens to come forward with their sponsors.
The Celebrant then asks the following question of those to be admitted.
If desired, the question may be asked of each person individually.
Answer
What do you seek?
Life in Christ.
The Celebrant then says,
Jesus said, “The first commandment is this: Hear, O Israel:
The Lord our God is the only Lord. Love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
strength. The second is this: Love your neighbor as yourself.
There is no other commandment greater than these.” Do you
accept these commandments?
Answer
I do.
Catechumenate
Celebrant Do you promise to be regular in attending the
Answer
worship of God and in receiving instruction?
I do.
Celebrant Will you open your ears to hear the Word of God
Answer
and your heart and mind to receive the Lord Jesus?
I will, with God’s help.
The Celebrant then addresses the sponsors
Will you who sponsor these persons support them by prayer
and example and help them to grow in the knowledge and
love of God?
Sponsors
I will.
Those to be admitted kneel. The sponsors remain standing, and place a
hand upon the shoulder of the one they are sponsoring, while the
Celebrant extends a hand toward them and says
May Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who has put the
desire into your hearts to seek the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, grant you the power of the Holy Spirit to persevere in
this intention and to grow in faith and understanding.
People
Amen.
Each of those to be admitted is presented by name to the Celebrant,
who, with the thumb, marks a cross on the forehead of each, saying
N., receive the sign of the Cross on your forehead and in
your heart, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit.
People
Amen.
The Sponsors also mark a cross on the foreheads of their catechumens.
Catechumenate
The catechumens and sponsors then return to their places.
The Liturgy continues with (the Creed and) the Prayers of the People, in
the course of which prayer is offered for the new catechumens by name.
If any of the catechumens, after consultation with the celebrant, wishes
to renounce a former way of worship, an appropriately worded
renunciation may be included immediately following the first question
and answer.
During the Catechumenate
During this period, and continuing through the period of Candidacy,
formal instruction is given to the catechumens. At the conclusion of each
session, a period of silence is observed, during which the catechumens
pray for themselves and one another. Sponsors and other baptized
persons present offer their prayers for the catechumens. The instructor
then says one or two of the following or some other suitable prayers, and
concludes by laying a hand individually on the head of each catechumen
in silence. It is traditional that this act be performed by the instructor,
whether bishop, priest, deacon, or lay catechist.
O God, the creator and savior of all flesh, look with mercy on
your children whom you call to yourself in love. Cleanse
their hearts and guard them as they prepare to receive your
Sacraments that, led by your Holy Spirit, they may be united
with your Son, and enter into the inheritance of your sons
and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Catechumenate
O God of truth, of beauty, and of goodness, we give you
thanks that from the beginning of creation you have revealed
yourself in the things that you have made; and that in every
nation, culture, and language there have been those who,
seeing your works, have worshiped you and sought to do
your will. Accept our prayers for these your servants whom
you have called to know and love you as you have been
perfectly revealed in your Son Jesus Christ our Redeemer, and
bring them with joy to new birth in the waters of Baptism;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
O God of righteousness and truth, you inaugurated your
victory over the forces of deceit and sin by the Advent of
your Son: Give to these catechumens a growing
understanding of the truth as it is in Jesus; and grant that
they, being cleansed from sin and born again in the waters of
Baptism, may glorify with us the greatness of your Name;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
O God, in your pity you looked upon a fallen world, and
sent your only Son among us to vanquish the powers of
wickedness. Deliver these your servants from slavery to sin
and evil. Purify their desires and thoughts with the light of
your Holy Spirit. Nourish them with your holy Word,
strengthen them in faith, and confirm them in good works;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Look down in mercy, Lord, upon these catechumens now
being taught in your holy Word. Open their ears to hear and
Catechumenate
their hearts to obey. Bring to their minds their past sins,
committed against you and against their neighbors, that they
may truly repent of them. And in your mercy preserve them
in their resolve to seek your kingdom and your
righteousness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Drive out of these catechumens, Lord God, every trace of
wickedness. Protect them from the Evil One. Bring them to
the saving waters of baptism, and make them yours for ever;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Lord Jesus Christ, loving Redeemer of all, you alone have
the power to save. At your Name every knee shall bow,
whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth. We pray to
you for these catechumens who seek to serve you, the one
true God. Send your light into their hearts, protect them
from the hatred of the Evil One, heal in them the wounds of
sin, and strengthen them against temptation. Give them a
love of your commandments, and courage to live always by
your Gospel, and so prepare them to receive your Spirit; you
who live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.
Most merciful God, behold and sustain these catechumens
who seek to know you more fully: Free them from the grasp
of Satan, and make them bold to renounce all sinful desires
that entice them from loving you; that, coming in faith to
the Sacrament of Baptism, they may commit themselves to
you, receive the seal of the Holy Spirit, and share with us in
the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Catechumenate
Lord God, unfailing light and source of light, by the death
and resurrection of your Christ you have cast out hatred and
deceit, and poured upon the human family the light of truth
and love: Look upon these catechumens whom you have
called to enter your covenant, free them from the power of
the Prince of darkness, and number them among the
children of promise; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Stir up, O Lord, the wills of these catechumens, and assist
them by your grace, that they may bring forth plenteously
the fruit of good works, and receive from you a rich reward;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Enrollment of Candidates for Baptism
The enrollment of candidates for Baptism at the Great Vigil of Easter
normally takes place on the First Sunday in Lent. For those preparing for
Baptism on the Feast of our Lord’s Baptism, it takes place on the First
Sunday of Advent.
The large book in which the names of the candidates for Baptism are to
be written is placed where it can easily be seen and used.
After the Creed, the catechumens to be enrolled are invited to come
forward with their sponsors.
A Catechist, or other lay representative of the congregation, presents
them to the bishop or priest with the following or similar words
Catechumenate
I present to you these catechumens who have been
strengthened by God’s grace and supported by the example
and prayers of this congregation, and I ask that they be
enrolled as candidates for Holy Baptism.
The Celebrant asks the sponsors
Have they been regular in attending the worship of God and
in receiving instruction?
Sponsors
They have. (He has.)
Celebrant
Are they seeking by prayer, study, and example to
pattern their lives in accordance with the Gospel?
They are. (He is.)
Sponsors
The Celebrant asks the sponsors and congregation
As God is your witness, do you approve the enrolling of
these catechumens as candidates for Holy Baptism?
Answer
We do.
The Celebrant addresses the catechumens
Do you desire to be baptized?
Catechumens
I do.
The Celebrant then says
In the Name of God, and with the consent of this
congregation, I accept you as candidates for Holy Baptism,
and direct that your names be written in this book. God
grant that they may also be written in the Book of Life.
The candidates then publicly write their names in the book; or, if
necessary, someone else may write the names. Each name is said aloud at
the time of writing. The sponsors may also sign the book.
Catechumenate
The candidates remain together at the front of the church while the
Deacon, or other person appointed, leads the following litany:
In peace let us pray to the Lord, saying “Lord, have mercy.”
For these catechumens, that they may remember this day on
which they were chosen, and remain for ever grateful for this
heavenly blessing, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
That they may use this Lenten season wisely, joining with us
in acts of self-denial and in performing works of mercy, let
us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For their teachers, that they may make known to those
whom they teach the riches of the Word of God, let us pray
to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For their sponsor(s), that in their private lives and public
actions they may show to these candidates a pattern of life in
accordance with the Gospel, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For their families and friends, that they may place no
obstacles in the way of these candidates, but rather assist
them to follow the promptings of the Spirit, let us pray to
the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For this congregation, that [during this Lenten season] it
may abound in love and persevere in prayer, let us pray to
the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For our Bishop, and for all the clergy and people, let us pray
to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
Catechumenate
For our President, for the leaders of the nations, and for all
in authority, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For the sick and the sorrowful, and for those in any need or
trouble, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For __________, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
For all who have died in the hope of the resurrection, and for
all the departed, let us pray to the Lord.
Lord, have mercy.
In the communion of [__________ and of all the ] saints, let
us commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life, to
Christ our God.
To you, O Lord our God.
Silence
The Celebrant says the following prayer with hands extended over the
candidates
Immortal God, Lord Jesus Christ, the protector of all who
come to you, the life of those who believe, and the
resurrection of the dead: We call upon you for these your
servants who desire the grace of spiritual rebirth in the
Sacrament of Holy Baptism. Accept them, Lord Christ, as
you promised when you said, “Ask, and it will be given you;
seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.”
Give now, we pray, to those who ask, let those who seek
find, open the gate to those who knock; that these your
servants may receive the everlasting benediction of your
heavenly washing, and come to that promised kingdom
which you have prepared, and where you live and reign for
ever and ever. Amen.
Catechumenate
The candidates then return to their places and the Liturgy continues with
the Confession of Sin or with the Peace.
During Candidacy
On the Sundays preceding their baptism, the candidates attend public
worship with their sponsors, and both the candidates and sponsors are
prayed for by name in the Prayers of the People. (When Eucharistic
Prayer D is used, however, it is appropriate that the names be inserted at
the place provided in that prayer.)
In addition, the following prayers and blessings may be used
immediately before the Prayers of the People, especially on the Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Sundays in Lent (or, the Second, Third, and Fourth
Sundays of Advent). When these prayers are used, the candidates and
sponsors are called forward. The candidates kneel or bow their heads.
The sponsors each place a hand upon the shoulder of their candidate.
The Celebrant then calls the people to prayer in these or similar words
Let us pray in silence, dearly beloved, for these candidates
who are preparing to receive the illumination of the Holy
Spirit in the Sacrament of Baptism.
All pray in silence.
The Celebrant says one of the following prayers:
Lord God, in the beginning of creation you called forth light
to dispel the darkness that lay upon the face of the deep:
Deliver these your servants from the powers of evil and
illumine them with the light of your presence, that with
open eyes and glad hearts they may worship you and serve
you, now and for ever; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Catechumenate
or this
Lord Christ, true Light who enlightens every one: Shine, we
pray, in the hearts of these candidates, that they may
clearly see the way that leads to life eternal, and may follow
it without stumbling; for you yourself are the Way, O Christ,
as you are the Truth and the Life; and you live and reign for
ever and ever. Amen.
or this
Come, O Holy Spirit, come; come as the wind and cleanse;
come as the fire and burn; convict, convert, and consecrate
the minds and hearts of these your servants, to their great
good and to your great glory; who with the Father and the
Son are one God, now and for ever. Amen.
The Celebrant lays a hand on the head of each candidate in silence.
The Celebrant then adds one of the following blessings:
May Almighty God bestow upon you the blessing of his
mercy, and give you an understanding of the wisdom that
leads to salvation; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
or this
May Almighty God keep your steps from wandering from
the way of truth, and cause you to walk in the paths of peace
and love; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
or this
May Almighty God nourish you with true knowledge of the
catholic faith, and grant you to persevere in every good
work; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
The candidates and sponsors return to their places and the Liturgy
continues.
Catechumenate
Additional Directions
1. When there are catechumens who are candidates for baptism at the
Great Vigil of Easter, it is appropriate in any year with the consent of
the Bishop to use the Sunday lectionary for Year A during Lent and the
Great Fifty Days of Easter.
2. In parishes where catechumens are dismissed from the Sunday
Eucharist, it is appropriate that this take place following the sermon.
The celebrant should send them forth from the Assembly with a
blessing and commission to study the Word they have received.
Catechumens should be accompanied from the Assembly by their
sponsors and catechists to the place for the catechetical session.
3. It is appropriate that the Apostles’ (or Nicene) Creed be given to the
Candidates for Baptism on the Third Sunday in Lent and the Lord’s
Prayer be given to them on the Fifth Sunday in Lent. (This may follow
the Prayers for the candidates for Baptism on those Sundays. See page
126.)
The Presentation of the Creed (Third Sunday in Lent)
Either the Apostles’ or Nicene Creed may be given to the Candidates,
but preference is here indicated for the Apostles’ Creed. On the
occasion of their Baptism at the Great Vigil of Easter, candidates will
recite the Apostles’ Creed in the Baptismal Covenant.
Immediately after the Sermon, candidates and sponsors are called
forward for (the Prayers for the Candidates for Baptism, and for) the
Presentation of the Creed. The Candidates kneel or bow their heads.
The sponsors each place a hand upon the shoulder of their candidate.
Catechumenate
One of the catechists says
Let the candidate(s) for Baptism now receive the Creed from the
Church.
The People and Celebrant say the Creed, all standing.
Apostles’ Creed—BCP, page 66 or 96
(or Nicene Creed—BCP, page 326 or 358)
The Celebrant concludes (dismissal of the candidates is optional)
(Candidate(s) go in peace.) May the Lord remain with you
always. Amen.
Candidates and sponsors are dismissed, or return to their places in the
congregation.
The Presentation of the Lord’s Prayer (Fifth Sunday in Lent)
When the candidates have been baptized at the Great Vigil of Easter
and take part in their first celebration of the Eucharist, they will join the
rest of the faithful in saying the Lord’s Prayer.
Immediately after the Sermon, candidates and sponsors are called
forward for (the Prayers for the Candidates for Baptism and for) the
Presentation of the Lord’s Prayer. (The Creed may be omitted on this
day.) The candidates kneel or bow their heads. The sponsors each
place a hand upon the shoulder of their candidate.
One of the catechists says
Let the candidate(s) for Baptism now receive the Lord’s Prayer
from the Church.
Catechumenate
Celebrant
As our Savior Christ
has taught us
we are bold to say,
As our Savior Christ
has taught us,
we now pray,
People and Celebrant
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name,
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your Name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those
who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial,
and deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power
and the glory are yours,
now and for ever. Amen.
The Celebrant concludes (dismissal of the candidates is optional)
(Candidate(s) go in peace.) May the Lord remain with you
always. Amen.
Candidates and sponsors are dismissed, or return to their places in the
congregation.
Catechumenate
A Vigil on the Eve of Baptism
When it is desired to celebrate a vigil on the eve of the Bishops Visitation
or other occasion in preparation for the administration of baptism at a
principal Sunday morning service, the following order may be used.
The Vigil begins with the Service of Light, Prayer Book page 109, and
continues, after the Phos hilaron, with the Salutation and Collect. Three
or more of the appointed Lessons are read before the Gospel, each
followed by a period of silence and a Psalm, Canticle, or hymn.
If the Vigil takes place on the eve of Pentecost, All Saints’ Day or the
Sunday following, or the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord, the Proper
Collect, Psalms, and Lessons appointed for those vigils are used. On
other occasions any appropriate Collect may be selected, and the
Readings chosen from among the following:
The Story of the Flood
Genesis (7:1-5,11-18); 8:6-18; 9:8-13
Psalm 25:3-9,
or
Psalm 46

After the Gospel (and homily) the candidates and their sponsors are
called forward. The candidates kneel or bow their heads. The Sponsors
each place a hand upon the shoulder of their candidate. The Celebrant
then lays a hand on the head of each candidate in silence.
The Celebrant then says one of the following forms of prayer, after
which a hymn may be sung. The service then concludes with a blessing
or dismissal, or both.
Form 1
Holy Trinity, one God, be present at the font tomorrow
for the sake of these your servants. Amen.

Vigil Before Baptism
Concerning Reaffirmation
of Baptismal Vows
This series of rites and stages of preparation employs a process similar
to that of the catechumenate to prepare mature baptized persons to
reaffirm their baptismal covenant and receive the laying on of hands by
the bishop. It is also appropriate for already confirmed persons who
wish to enter a time of disciplined renewal of the baptismal covenant
and for those who have transferred into a new congregation. This
process may also be used for returning persons who have been
separated from the church due to notorious sins. Care, however, should
be taken in distinguishing such “penitents” from the other persons in
this process, in the preservation of confidentiality, and the penitent’s
own participation in the process conducted with pastoral sensitivity.
It is important to note, however, that this is not the catechumenate,
which is appropriate only for the unbaptized. In some congregations,
it may be desirable, due to limited resources, for catechumens and the
previously baptized to attend meetings together during each stage.
Care should be taken, however, to underscore the full and complete
Christian membership of the baptized. For this reason, the rites of the
catechumenate are not appropriate for them. During meetings, prayers
offered for the baptized should acknowledge their baptism. Good
examples of such prayers are found in the weekday collects for the
Great Fifty Days of Easter in Lesser Feasts and Fasts. When they join
the catechumens in their meetings, the baptized may appropriately be
considered as assisting the catechists.
There are three stages of preparation and formation, each concluding
with a rite as a transition. (The first rite, however, is used only for those
baptized members who are returning to the church from a period of
inactivity and for those coming from other traditions.) A final period
after the third rite leads to the Reaffirmation of the Baptismal Covenant
at the Easter Vigil and the presentation of the candidate to the bishop
for Confirmation, Reception, or Commitment to Christian Service
during the Great Fifty Days of Easter. Throughout, the candidate is
Reaffirmation
valued by the community as a living example of our common need to
reexamine and reaffirm our baptismal covenant, and as a model of
conversion.
Lastly, the rites attempt to make full use of the existing symbolic
language of the liturgy, through the use of actions and physical symbols
as well as words.
Stage One. A period of inquiry designed for story sharing and to give
persons enough information about Christian faith and practice and the
life of the local community so they may determine if they wish to enter
a disciplined period of mature formation in the story of God’s saving
deeds, prayer, worship, and service. At the conclusion of this period,
one or more sponsors are chosen from the local congregation.
rite one Page 139
Welcoming Returning Members and
Members Baptized in other Traditions
Stage Two. This is a longer period during which those being formed,
along with sponsors, catechists, and other members of the community
engage in deeper exploration of faith and ministry.
This formation period is based on a pattern of experience followed by
reflection. The baptized persons explore the meanings of baptism and
the baptismal covenant, while discerning the type of service to which
God calls them in the context of the local community. The sponsors
and catechists in turn train and support them in that service and help
them to reflect theologically on their experience of ministry through the
study of Scripture, in prayer, and in worship. Substantial periods of
time are spent doing ministry and reflecting on it with catechists and
sponsors.
Baptized candidates take part in the Eucharist, including the reception
of Holy Communion, unless prevented by penitential discipline.
Reaffirmation
This rite is used for baptized persons who are returning to active church
life after having lived apart from the Church. It is also appropriate for
persons coming into this Church from another tradition.
Active baptized members of this Church simply enter the second stage
without any rite although prayer may be offered in the context of this
rite for “other members of this Church who are preparing to reaffirm
their baptismal covenant.”
rite two Page 141
Enrollment for Lenten Preparation
Stage Three. This is a stage of immediate preparation for Reaffirmation
of the Baptismal Covenant at the Easter Vigil. The candidates focus
on the Lenten disciplines and their role in ministry to others. In their
group meetings, candidates for reaffirmation share their ongoing
experience of conversion—especially with those catechumens who are
preparing for baptism—and explore more deeply the life of prayer and
ministry.
rite three Page 144
Maundy Thursday Rite of Preparation for the Paschal Holy Days
The baptized reaffirm their baptismal covenant at the Easter Vigil. It
is appropriate for them to join those baptized at the same Vigil in the
post-baptismal catechesis during the Great Fifty Days of Easter. If the
Bishop was not present at the Vigil, the baptized are presented to the
Bishop for the laying on of hands, preferably during the Great Fifty
Days as appropriate.

Baptized Persons for

Welcoming Returning Members and
Members Baptized in Other Traditions
This rite is used at the principal Sunday Eucharist. It is provided for
baptized persons who have returned to the life of the Church after a
time away and for members baptized in other traditions. Those who
wish to pursue a disciplined exploration of the implications of Christian
living are recognized by the community and welcomed to begin this
process.
During the Prayers of the People, those about to be welcomed are
prayed for by name.
After the Prayers of the People, the senior warden or other
representative of the community presents the baptized to the celebrant
with these or other words:
N., We present to you these persons (or N., N.,) who are
baptized members of the Body of Christ and we welcome
them to our community as they undertake a process of
growth in the meaning of their baptism.

Maundy Thursday Rite of Preparation
for the Paschal Holy Days
This rite is used at the principal service on Maundy Thursday.
If there are penitents they will have taken part in the Reconciliation of
a Penitent or other appropriate ministry in which they are assured of
God’s pardon before participating in this rite.
When this rite is used, the appropriate Gospel is John 13: 1-15. Before
the foot-washing ceremony, those preparing for reaffirmation and their
sponsors stand before the celebrant in full view of the congregation.
The celebrant addresses the people in the following form rather than the
form on page 93 of this book.
Celebrant
(to those preparing for reaffirmation and their sponsors) N.,
N., you have been setting an example for us of
that true turning to God which lies at the heart of
our Christian calling. Tonight we welcome you to
join us as disciples of Jesus Christ by imitating his
example and dedicating ourselves to service among
us in this community. Christ Jesus came among
us not to be served but to serve. Tonight we wash
your feet as a sign of the servanthood to which
Christ has called us and we ask you in turn to join
us in this symbol of our discipleship. N., N., are
you prepared to join us in our life of service?
Candidates We are prepared.
The service continues with a rite of reconciliation, beginning on page
450 of the Book of Common Prayer with the words, “Now, in the
presence of Christ. . .” omitting the confession of particular sins
(“Especially...”). The Celebrant lays a hand on each one while saying
the first form of absolution (“Our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered. . .”).
Reaffirmation
Their feet are washed. When all are ready, the celebrant distributes
basins, ewers, and towels to them, saying to each:
Celebrant
May Christ strengthen you in the service which he lays upon
you.
They in turn wash the feet of other members of the congregation.
The service continues with the Prayers of the People and the Peace.
If a Confession of Sin is to be used in this service it takes place at the
beginning using the Penitential Order on page 319 or page 351 in the
Book of Common Prayer.

Blessed are you, Lord God. Let the fullness of your blessing

The anticipation of birth is an appropriate time for the Minister of the
Congregation to discuss with expectant parents the meaning of Baptism.
Blessing of a Pregnant Woman
The Preparation of Parents
and Godparents for
the Baptism of Infants
and Young Children
Concerning the Service
This process is designed to deepen the Christian formation of those
who will present infants and young children for baptism. Its division
into stages––each concluding with a rite––parallels the form of
the catechumenate. It is essential, however, that these persons be
distinguished from the catechumens except when they may be themselves
preparing for baptism, and therefore catechumens.
Stage One. This stage begins as soon as the parents discover the
pregnancy. In consultation with the pastor, they choose godparents. The
godparents must be baptized persons and at least one a member of the
local community. A schedule of meetings throughout the pregnancy is
planned. This is a brief stage, leading shortly to the first rite.
rite one
The Blessing of Parents at the Beginning of the Pregnancy
This rite “The Blessing of a Pregnant Woman,” appears on page 157.
In order to more strongly indicate the role of the father, the following
changes should be made, in addition to changing the title. (If the father
is not present or not involved, the rite follows the form for a woman,
omitting the father’s name in the prayers.)
Parents and Godparents
In the opening prayer, the father’s name as well as the mother’s is used,
and “they” replaces “she.”
After the fourth petition is added:
Blessed are you, our God. May N. and N., along with their
child’s godparents, N. and N. (and N. and N., their other
children), find their faith deepened and their ministry
strengthened as they prepare for this child’s birth and
baptism. Amen.
This rite takes place at the Sunday Eucharist after the Prayers of the
People. It is followed by the Peace.
Stage Two. This period consists of the remainder of the pregnancy and
the time of birth. During this stage, the parents, their other children, and
the godparents meet regularly with one or more catechists to deepen their
formation in salvation history, prayer, worship, and social ministry. Its
educational pattern is one of experience followed by reflection. In their
daily lives, participants find ample resources for reflection upon the ways
in which their own baptismal covenant is being lived within their
vocation of marriage, family and child-bearing. They also explore prayer
and worship in the home as an extension of the liturgy of the Church and
in the context of the Church Year, and they grow in an understanding of
the household as a domestic manifestation of the People of God whose
life together is part of the history of salvation.
If a parent is a catechumen, this process takes place within the
catechumenate. A baptized spouse may serve to sponsor the catechumen.
rite two
Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child
This rite is found in the Book of Common Prayer (pages 439-445). Of
the final prayers, the prayer “For a child not yet baptized” (page 444) is
appropriate. The celebrant signs the infant with the cross and announces
the date of the baptism. Henceforth the child is prayed for by name at the
Prayers of the People, until the baptismal day.
Parents and Godparents
Stage Three. In this period of preparation for baptism, the parents and
godparents continue to meet with the catechist(s). Couples or individuals
who have raised children in the Church may be helpful as resources or
catechists, as may be others who have completed this process previously.
The experience of parenthood furnishes new challenges to faith and
ministry upon which reflection will be fruitful. The process of family life,
sharing in the congregation’s life of worship, and ministry to others will
find new shape with the advent of the new child.
This is also a time to explore more fully the responsibilities that the
parents and godparents will accept at the baptism. They explore topics
such as: the best way to interpret the meaning of the Eucharist to a child
partaking of it in his or her growing years; how to model ministry and
prayer for the growing child; and ways of introducing the child to the
story of salvation. The role of the godparents is also more fully
developed.
rite three Book of Common Prayer, Page 299
Holy Baptism
In accordance with the Book of Common Prayer, this will take place on a
major baptismal day at a principal service of worship. The infant will be
signed (with chrism, if desired) and may receive Holy Communion (in the
form of a few drops of wine if the child is not yet weaned).
After this, the parents, godparents and congregation have the
responsibility of carrying out the child’s formation in salvation history,
prayer, worship, and social ministry. Childhood and adolescence will
be a time of formation and exploration of the mysteries of the faith,
moving towards the goal of reaffirmation of the baptismal covenant at
a mature age.
Those who lead this preparation process should include laity and clergy.
Deacons have a special role as leaders of servant ministry, as do those
who have reared children in the Church, even if they seem to have had
little success. Whenever possible, the bishop should preside over the rites
and take part in the teaching. The bishop will also preside at the baptism
whenever possible.
Parents and Godparents
Adaptation for Special Circumstances
Deferred Baptism
In the case of young children, the parents may, in consultation with the
pastor of the congregation, determine to defer baptism until the child is
old enough to go through the catechumenate. In such case, parents go
through the same process during the pregnancy and birth, but the stages
conclude not with baptism but with the admission of the child to the
catechumenate (page 117). The parents and godparents should receive
ongoing support in the formation of the child.
Other Adaptations
When parents present a child for baptism without having gone through
this process beginning at pregnancy, the first and second stages above are
combined. The first rite is dropped and the second rite is the enrollment
of the child as a candidate for baptism (adapted to circumstances). After
a final period of preparation (perhaps along with adult candidates), the
child is baptized.
It is important to acknowledge that, if a difficulty arises during the course
of the pregnancy, the godparents and catechists are the primary ministers
to the parents. If the pregnancy is terminated by miscarriage, or if the
baby is stillborn, these persons continue to support and assist the parents
in dealing with such an event.
It should be noted that a baby with congenital deficiencies (including
mental or learning disabilities) should be baptized. In cases where it
seems necessary to perform an emergency baptism, the sponsoring group
supports the parents. If the infant survives, the formative period may
continue and the formal celebration of the baptism takes place on a
major baptismal day.
Parents and Godparents
Anniversary of a Marriage
This form is intended for use in the context of a celebration of the Holy
Eucharist. When the form is used at a principal service on a Sunday or
Major Holy Day, the Proper of the Day is used. When it is used at other
times, the Psalm and Lessons are selected from those recommended for
use at the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage, and one of the
following Collects is used for the Collect of the Day.
O gracious and everliving God, look mercifully on N. and
N., who come to renew the promises they have made to each
other. Grant them your blessing, and assist them with your
grace, that with true fidelity and steadfast love they may
honor and keep their promises and vows; through Jesus
Christ our Savior, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity
of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
or this
O God, you have so consecrated the covenant of marriage
that in it is represented the spiritual unity between Christ
and his Church: Send your blessing upon N. and N., who
come to renew their promises to each other, and grant them
your grace, that they may so love, honor, and cherish each
other in faithfulness and patience, in wisdom and true
godliness, that their lives together may be a witness to your
love and forgiveness, and that their home may be a haven of
blessing and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives
Anniversary of a Marriage
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and
for ever. Amen.
or this
Grant, O God, in your compassion, that N. and N., having
taken each other in marriage, and affirming again the
covenant which they have made, may grow in forgiveness,
loyalty, and love; and come at last to the eternal joys which
you have promised through Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives
and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,
for ever and ever. Amen.
Immediately after the Sermon (and the Creed if appointed), the Husband
and Wife present themselves before the celebrant, who stands facing the
people.
All stand, and the Celebrant addresses the congregation with these or
similar words
Friends in Christ, we are gathered together with N. and N.,
who have come today to give thanks to God for his blessing
upon their marriage, and to reaffirm their marriage
covenant.
The Celebrant then asks the man
N., do you here, in the presence of God and of this
congregation, renew the promises you made when you
bound yourself to N. in holy matrimony?
The Man answers
I do.
The Celebrant then asks the woman
N., do you here, in the presence of God and of this
congregation, renew the promises you made when you
bound yourself to N. in holy matrimony?
Anniversary of a Marriage
The Woman answers
I do.
The Husband and Wife, kneeling or standing, say together
We thank you, most gracious God, for consecrating our
marriage in Christ’s Name and presence. Lead us further in
companionship with each other and with you. Give us grace
to live together in love and fidelity, with care for one
another. Strengthen us all our days, and bring us to that holy
table where, with those we love, we will feast for ever in our
heavenly home; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
The Celebrant then blesses them, saying
May God the Father, who at creation ordained that man and
woman become one flesh, keep you one. Amen.
May God the Son, who adorned this manner of life by his
first miracle, at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, be present
with you always. Amen.
May God the Holy Spirit, who has given you the will to
persevere in your love and in your covenant with each other,
strengthen your bond. Amen.
And may God the Holy Trinity, the source of all unity, bless
you this day and for ever. Amen.
The service continues with the Peace, or, at a principal service, with the
Prayers of the People.
The husband and wife may present the bread and wine at the Offertory.
If there is not to be a Communion, the service concludes with the Lord’s
Prayer and the Peace.
When this form is used as an act of reconciliation, the celebrant may
adapt it in consultation with the parties.

God; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the
Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.
Amen.
One or two Lessons are read before the Gospel.
Between the Lessons, and before the Gospel, a Psalm, hymn, or anthem
may be sung or said.

The Celebrant concludes the Prayers with one of the following or some
other suitable Collect:
Almighty God, giver of life and health: Send your blessing
on all who are sick, and upon those who minister to them,
that all weakness may be vanquished by the triumph of the
risen Christ; who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
or this
Heavenly Father, you have promised to hear what we ask in
the Name of your Son: Accept and fulfill our petitions, we
pray, not as we ask in our ignorance, nor as we deserve in
our sinfulness, but as you know and love us in your Son

The Celebrant says the following blessing over those who have come
forward
The Almighty Lord, who is a strong tower to all who put
their trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, on earth,
and under the earth bow and obey: Be now and evermore
your defense, and make you know and feel that the only
Name under heaven given for health and salvation is the
Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
The Celebrant then lays hands on each person (and, having dipped a
thumb in the oil of the sick, makes the sign of the cross on their
foreheads), and says one of the following:
N., I lay my hands upon you [and anoint you with oil] in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
beseeching our Lord Jesus Christ to sustain you with his
presence, to drive away all sickness of body and spirit, and
to give you that victory of life and peace which will enable
you to serve him both now and evermore. Amen.
or this
N., I lay my hands upon you [and anoint you with oil] in the

Prayer and the prayer and blessing given below.

In place of the usual postcommunion prayer (or, if there has not been a
Communion, after the Lord’s Prayer), the following prayer is said
Almighty and eternal God, so draw our hearts to you, so
guide our minds, so fill our imaginations, so control our
wills, that we may be wholly yours, utterly dedicated to you;
and then use us, we pray, as you will, and always to your
glory and the welfare of your people; through our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
The Celebrant pronounces this blessing
May God the Father bless you, God the Son heal you, God
the Holy Spirit give you strength. May God the holy and
undivided Trinity guard your body, save your soul, and bring
you safely to his heavenly country; where he lives and reigns
for ever and ever. Amen.

Concerning Exorcism
The practice of expelling evil spirits by means of prayer and set
formulas derives its authority from the Lord himself who identified
these acts as signs of his messiahship. Very early in the life of the
Church the development and exercise of such rites were reserved to
the bishop, at whose discretion they might be delegated to selected
presbyters and others deemed competent.
In accordance with this established tradition, those who find
themselves in need of such a ministry should make the fact known to
the bishop, through their parish priest, in order that the bishop may
determine whether exorcism is needed, who is to perform the rite, and
what prayers or other formularies are to be used.

O God of grace and glory, we remember before you this day

console us who mourn. Give us quiet confidence that we
may continue our course in faith; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.
O merciful Father, you have taught us in your holy Word
that you do not willingly afflict or grieve your children:
Look with pity upon the sorrows of your servants for whom
our prayers are offered. Remember them, O Lord, in mercy,
nourish their souls with patience, comfort them with a sense
of your goodness, lift up your countenance upon them, and
give them peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

fears and worldly anxieties, that no clouds of this mortal life
may hide from us the light of that love which is immortal,
and which you have manifested to us in your Son Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.
Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of
darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of
this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit
us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come
again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the
dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who
lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.

The Committal
Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have
mercy upon us.
You only are immortal, the creator and maker of mankind;
and we are mortal, formed of the earth, and to earth shall we
return. For so did you ordain when you created me, saying,
“You are dust, and to dust you shall return.” All of us go
down to the dust; yet even at the grave we make our song:
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have
mercy upon us.

Morning or Evening Prayer, or separately.
After the Examination, each group of candidates is presented separately
by an appointed sponsor.
Symbols appropriate to the ministry may be given to the candidates as
they are commissioned.
When the number of candidates for any office is large, it is sufficient to
say the sentence of commissioning once over the entire group, but it is
desirable that each person be greeted individually (and be given an
appropriate symbol).

ministries for the common good. Our purpose is to
commission these persons in the Name of God and of this
congregation to a special ministry to which they are called.

commitment to Christ as Lord, by regular attendance at
worship, and by the knowledge of their duties, to exercise
their ministry to the honor of God, and the well-being of his
Church?

intended. If a rite of dedication is desired, one of the following forms
Church Furnishings & Ornaments
may be used after the sermon (and Creed) at the Eucharist, or at the
Daily Office at the time of the hymn or anthem following the Collects
It is appropriate, when the object to be dedicated is fixed, that there be a
procession to that place. If the procession is to a distant place, an anthem
(the text of which may be the appointed antiphon), psalm, or hymn may
be sung. When the object is portable, it should be brought to the Altar
and presented to the celebrant.
The appointed antiphons may be read or sung by all, or by the celebrant,
or by some other person.
If a longer form is desired, the presentation, versicles, and prayers on
pages 212-213 may be used in connection with the proper form.
1. An Altar
(Reserved to the Bishop)
The dedication of an Altar takes place immediately before the Peace.
Antiphon
Arise, go to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar
to our God.
V. I will go to the altar of God:
R. To the God of my joy and gladness.
Let us pray. (Silence)
The Bishop, standing at the Table with arms extended, says
We praise you, Almighty and eternal God, that for us and
our salvation, you sent your Son Jesus Christ to be born
among us, that through him we might become your sons and
daughters.
Blessed be your Name, Lord God.

exalting him to be our great High Priest.
Blessed be your Name, Lord God.
We praise you for sending your Holy Spirit to make us holy,
and to unite us in your holy Church.
Blessed be your Name, Lord God.
The Bishop lays a hand upon the Table, and continues
Lord God, hear us. Sanctify this Table dedicated to you. Let
it be to us a sign of the heavenly Altar where your saints and
angels praise you for ever. Accept here the continual
recalling of the sacrifice of your Son. Grant that all who eat
and drink at this holy Table may be fed and refreshed by his
flesh and blood, be forgiven for their sins, united with one
another, and strengthened for your service.
Blessed be your Name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now
and for endless ages. Amen.
Bells may then be rung and music played. If desired, the Bishop may
cense the Altar. Members of the congregation then vest it, place the
vessels on it, and light the candles. The Liturgy then continues with the
Peace.

public Baptism, in which case the following is inserted immediately

Facing the Font, the Bishop says
We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water. Over it
the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation. Through
it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage in Egypt
into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus received the
baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy Spirit as the
Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death and
resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.

fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit.
Grant, by the power of your Holy Spirit, that those who here

The Founding of a Church

Before the service, four stakes are set in the ground, at the corners of the
proposed building. Three cords are prepared, two to extend diagonally
from corner to corner, a third to enclose the space. A spade is placed at
the site of the Altar.
The bishop, or a priest appointed by the bishop, is the celebrant. Having
vested nearby, the ministers, with the people, go in procession to the site
of the building.

Then a Person appointed reads
Genesis 28:10-17
A sermon or address may follow.
While the following antiphon and psalm are being sung, persons

securing them to the stakes, thus forming the Greek letter X (chi), the
symbol both of the cross and of the name of Christ.
Antiphon (to be used before and after the Psalm)

Then, taking the spade, and breaking the ground, the Celebrant
continues

the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
May the Gospel be preached,

and glory of your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our
Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy

A Deacon or the Celebrant then dismisses the people.
Laying of a Cornerstone
If the laying of a cornerstone takes place before the building is erected,
the following order may be observed.
1. A hymn or anthem is sung.
2. A suitable passage of Scripture, such as Ephesians 2:19-22, may be
read.
3. An address follows.
4. An appropriate prayer, such as the Collect of the Patron or Title of
the Church, is said.
5. The cornerstone is then laid, after which the Celebrant prays as
follows
Founding of a Church
Let us pray.
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, you are the
brightness of the Father’s glory and the express image of his
person, the one foundation and the chief cornerstone: Bless
what we have now done in the laying of this stone. Be the
beginning, the increase, and the consummation of this work
undertaken to the glory of your Name; who with the Father
and the Holy Spirit live and reign, one God, for ever and
ever. Amen.
Trumpets may be sounded, and the Celebrant says
Praise the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the
Lord is laid!
The People respond, with a loud voice
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Applause may follow.
6. A hymn is sung, after which the rite is concluded with a blessing and
dismissal.
If the laying of a cornerstone takes place after the building is completed,
it is suitable that it take place in the context of a celebration of the Holy
Eucharist. After the homily, a hymn, psalm, or anthem is sung, during
which all go in procession to the site of the ceremony. An appropriate
prayer (such as the Collect of the Patron or Title of the Church) is said,
after which the cornerstone is laid. The rite then continues with the
Celebrant’s prayer given above. During the hymn that follows, the
procession returns to the church where the Liturgy continues with (the
Creed and) the Prayers of the People.
Founding of a Church
Concerning the Service
This service has been created to help congregations and dioceses
who are considering a new church mission, to discern the will of the
Holy Spirit. The service may also be used by a team preparing for a
new church plant, and/or be incorporated into one or several Sunday
services by supporting/sponsoring congregation(s). The service may
be used to initiate a period of intentional discernment; and at points
within that process.
The service encourages silence and stillness to listen to the movement
of the Holy Spirit. It is not a Eucharistic liturgy.
It is appropriate to adapt this rite to local custom, language, dialect,
and idiom.

Discernment for a New Church Mission 227
Concerning the Service
This liturgy is designed for use on the occasion when a selected and
trained church planter, missioner and/or mission team is to be sent
forth by a diocese (and sponsoring congregation), to a designated
location/congregation. If the new church has been named, there are
opportunities in the liturgy for that designation. The service should
be adapted to the mission circumstances.
This is a Eucharistic liturgy. It presumes the participation of the
diocesan bishop or bishop’s representative; clergy and other members
of any sponsoring congregation(s); and the church planter and his/
her team, their supporters, and members of the new church.
The liturgy is rooted in the imagery and theology of Baptism,
recognizing that the work of spreading the Gospel and building up
of Christ’s Body the Church is the work of all baptized persons. With
that understanding, particular ministers are commissioned and their
responsibilities recognized in this liturgy.
It is appropriate to adapt this rite to local custom, language, dialect,
and idiom.

Commissioning a Planter, Missioner, or Team 239
Concerning the Service
The opening service of a new congregation is a celebration for the
members of the new community, but more importantly, an opportunity
for them to show hospitality to those seeking a church home in the
broader community.
It is important to choose a day appropriate for the culture surrounding
the new mission–for example, the feast of the Epiphany is of particular
significance in the Hispanic community and an effective date for a
public launch. Days such as Palm Sunday, Easter, and Christmas are not
recommended. Experience shows that dates between late August through
the Last Sunday after Pentecost work well in most contexts.
The congregation is gathered to serve those coming for the first time, and
should be mindful of the opportunities to proclaim the Gospel within
the liturgy. The host members should be conscientious of the need for
simplicity and clarity. It is important that a variety of persons participate
in the leadership of the service.
This service assumes a Eucharistic context. It may be adapted to a service
of the Word.
If appropriate the Liturgy for Setting Apart Secular Space for Sacred Use
(page 245) may immediately precede the service.
It is appropriate to adapt this rite to local custom, language, dialect, and
idiom.

Opening a New Congregation 243
Concerning the Service
This rite is designed for use by a church planting team or new
congregation, as it begins worship in a facility such as a school, nursing
home, “storefront” or other secular space. With adaptation it could be
used in a variety of other situations, such as the initial gathering of a
retreat group in a hotel. It anticipates regular but not exclusive use of
the room or building for worship purposes. It may be desirable to place
in the room significant symbols of Christian worship, such as a cross,
candles, banner, etc., before or during the service.
An Entrance Hymn may be sung, and the congregation and liturgical
ministers may process to the site of dedication, if appropriate. A large
cross may be placed in a location visible to all.
It is appropriate to adapt this rite to local custom, language, dialect, and
idiom.

in the breaking of bread. Give us joy in all your works, and
grant that this space may be a place where your will is done
and your name is glorified; through Jesus Christ our Savior, in
the power of the Holy Spirit, we pray. Amen.
At a celebration of the Eucharist the Gloria in Excelsis or other Song of
Praise may be sung, as all take their places for worship. The Collect of

grupo que se prepara para fundar una iglesia. También puede ser
incorporado en uno o varios ritos de la(s) congregación(es) que
apoya(n) o patrocina(n) la misión. El rito se puede usar para iniciar

proceso.
El rito invita al silencio y a la calma para sentir el movimiento del
Espíritu Santo. No es una liturgia eucarística.

Discernimiento sobre la fundación de una iglesia 259
Lo Concerniente al Rito
Esta liturgia se ha pensado para cuando un fundador de iglesia, un
misionero o un grupo misionero, seleccionado y capacitado, va a ser
enviado por la diócesis (y por la congregación patrocinadora), a un
lugar reservado para una congregación. Si la nueva iglesia ya tiene
nombre, hay oportunidades en la liturgia para ese caso. El rito se
debe adaptar a las circunstancias de la misión.
Esta es una liturgia eucarística. Se da por entendido la participación
del obispo o su representante, del clero y otros miembros de la(s)
congregación(es) patrocinadora(s), del fundador de la iglesia y de su
equipo, de los que han apoyado al equipo y de los miembros de la
nueva iglesia.
Esta liturgia tiene sus raíces en los símbolos y teología del Bautismo,
reconociendo que el trabajo de divulgar el evangelio y de edificar
el Cuerpo de Cristo, que es la Iglesia, es una tarea de todos los
bautizados. Con esto en mente, en esta liturgia se comisionan a
determinados ministros y se reconocen sus responsabilidades.
Es apropiado adaptar estos ritos a constumbres locales de dialecto e
idioma.
260 Liturgia para comisionar

La Eucaristía continúa con la Gran Plegaria Eucarística, el obispo o su

fundadores asisten de acuerdo a su orden.
Excepto en fiestas mayores, el prefacio es el de Pentecostés.
En lugar de la Oración usual de poscomunión, se puede decir la siguiente:
Celebrante u otra persona designada
Eterno Dios, dador de amor y vida, nos has nutrido con el Cuerpo
y la Sangre de tu Hijo Jesucristo. Envíanos ahora al mundo para
predicar las Buenas Nuevas, para hacer tu justicia y para caminar

Liturgia para comisionar 269
Lo concerniente al Rito
El rito de inauguración de una congregación es una celebración para los
miembros de la nueva comunidad pero, todavía más importante, una
oportunidad para mostrar hospitalidad a todos aquellos que buscan una
iglesia a la cual asistir.
Es importante escoger un día apropiado dentro de la cultura que rodea
a la nueva misión, por ejemplo, la fiesta de la Epifanía tiene significado
especial en la comunidad hispana y es un día muy apto para captar
la atención del pueblo. No se recomiendan días como el Domingo de
Ramos, Pascua y Navidad. La experiencia demuestra que, en la mayoría
de las circunstancias, las mejores fechas van de finales de agosto al último
domingo de Pentecostés.
La congregación se reúne para servir a los que vienen por vez primera y
debe ser consciente de la oportunidad de proclamar el Evangelio en la
liturgia. Los miembros anfitriones se han de dar cuenta de la necesidad
de la claridad y simplicidad. Es importante que una variedad de personas
participe en el liderazgo del servicio.
Este rito da por entendido un contexto eucarístico. Se puede adaptar para
un rito de la Palabra.
Si es apropiado, puede preceder inmediatamente a la Liturgia para
reservar un espacio para el uso sagrado (página 275).
Es apropiado adaptar estos ritos a constumbres locales de dialecto e
idioma.

Lo Concerniente al Rito
Este rito se ha preparado para que lo use un equipo fundador o una
congregación nueva que empieza a tener servicios en una localidad
tal como una escuela, un asilo, o cualquier otro espacio secular.
Adaptándolo se puede usar en otras varias situaciones, como cuando
un grupo se reúne para un retiro en un hotel. Se espera que sea, pero no
exclusivamente, un lugar o edificio regular con fines de adoración. Se
podrían colocar en la habitación símbolos significativos cristianos, como
una cruz, velas, un estandarte, etc. antes o durante el rito.
De entrada se puede cantar un himno, y, si es apropiado, la congregación
y los ministros litúrgicos pueden ir en procesión hasta el lugar que va a
ser dedicado.

Concernant l’Office
Cet office a été créé pour aider les congrégations et les diocèses qui
prennent en considération une nouvelle mission d’église, à percevoir la
volonté du Saint-Esprit. L’office peut aussi être utilisé par une équipe qui
se prépare pour la fondation d’une nouvelle église et/ou être incorporé
à un ou plusieurs offices du dimanche par des congrégation(s) qui
supportent ou parrainent la mission. L’office peut être utilisé pour initier
une période de discernement intentionnel; et à d’autres points dans le
cadre de ce processus.
L’office encourage le silence et le calme pour écouter le mouvement du
Saint-Esprit. Ce n’est pas une liturgie eucharistique.
Il est approprié d’adapter ce rite à la coutume locale, à la langue, au
dialecte et à l’idiome.

Concernant l’Office
Cette liturgie est conçue pour être employée à l’occasion d’envoyer un
fondateur d’église, un missionnaire et/ou une équipe de mission choisis et
instruits par un diocèse (et une congrégation de support), à un endroit/
congrégation désigné. Si la nouvelle église a déjà un nom, il y a des
possibilités dans la liturgie pour cette désignation-là. L’office doit être
adapté aux circonstances de la mission.
C’est une liturgie eucharistique. Elle présuppose la participation de
l’évêque diocésain ou du représentant de l’évêque; du clergé et d’autres
membres des congrégation(s) de support; et du fondateur de l’église et
son équipe, leurs partisans et les membres de la nouvelle église.
La liturgie a ses racines dans les images et la théologie du Baptême,
reconnaissant que le travail de répandre l’Évangile et de construire
l’Église du Corps de Christ est le travail de toutes les personnes baptisées.
Avoir compris cela, des ministres particuliers sont mis en service et leurs
responsabilités sont reconnues dans cette liturgie.
Il est approprié d’adapter ce rite à la coutume locale, à la langue, au
dialecte et à l’idiome.

À l’exception des grandes fêtes, la Préface est celle de Pentecôte.
Au lieu de la prière habituelle qui suit la communion, on peut dire la

Liturgie pour mettre en service 301
Concernant l’Office
L’office d’inauguration d’une nouvelle congrégation est une célébration
pour les membres de la nouvelle communauté, mais plus important
encore, une occasion pour eux de montrer de l’hospitalité à ceux
cherchant une église dans la communauté plus large.
Il est important de choisir un jour approprié pour la culture entourant la
nouvelle mission Ð par exemple, la fête de l’Épiphanie a une importance
particulière dans la communauté hispanique, et une date efficace pour
un lancement public. Le Dimanche des Rameaux, de Pâques et le jour
de Noël sont déconseillés. L’expérience montre que les dates entre la fin
août et le Dernier Dimanche après la Pentecôte sont appropriées dans la
plupart des contextes.
La congrégation se réunit pour servir ceux qui viennent pour la première
fois et devraient être conscients des occasions de proclamer l’Évangile
dans la liturgie. Les membres hôtes devraient être consciencieux du
besoin de simplicité et de clarté. Il est important qu’une variété de
personnes participe à la conduite de l’office.
Cet office assume un contexte eucharistique. Il peut être adapté à un
office de la Parole.
S’il est approprié, la Liturgie pour Réserver un Espace Séculaire pour
l’Usage Sacré (page 307) peut précéder l’office immédiatement.
Il est approprié d’adapter ce rite à la coutume locale, à la langue, au
dialecte et à l’idiome.

L’inauguration d’une nouvelle congrégation 305
Concernant l’Office
Ce rite est conçu pour être utilisé par une équipe fondatrice d’une église
ou par une nouvelle congrégation, qui commence le culte dans un lieu tel
qu’une école, une maison de retraite, une « vitrine » ou tout autre espace
séculaire. Avec de l’adaptation il pourrait être employé dans une variété
d’autres situations, telles que le rassemblement initial d’un groupe de
retraite dans un hôtel. Il prévoit l’utilisation régulière mais non exclusive
de la salle ou du bâtiment pour le culte. Il peut être souhaitable de placer
dans la salle des symboles significatifs de culte chrétien, tels qu’une croix,
des bougies, une banderole etc. avant ou pendant le service.
Un hymne d’entrée peut être chanté et la congrégation et les ministres
liturgiques peuvent aller en procession à l’emplacement de dédicace, si
approprié. Une grande croix peut être placée dans un endroit visible à
tous.
Il est approprié d’adapter ce rite à la coutume locale, à la langue, au
dialecte et à l’idiome.

Restoring of Things Profaned
When a church building, altar, font, or other objects that have been set
apart or consecrated, have been profaned, they may be restored to sacred
use with the following form.
The bishop, or a priest, with such attendants as are appropriate, may go
in procession around the exterior or interior of the church, or chapel,
and then go to each object that has been profaned.
During the procession, Psalm 118 may be sung or said, with the
following antiphon
I saw water proceeding out of the temple; from the right side
it flowed, alleluia; and all those to whom that water came
shall be saved, and shall say, alleluia, alleluia.
After the procession, each profaned object is addressed, and may be
symbolically cleansed by the use of signs of purification, such as water or
incense. The Celebrant touches or extends a hand toward each object
and says
I declare this __________ restored to the use for which it has
been dedicated and consecrated.
Then the Celebrant, standing in the midst of the church, says
People
Our help is in the Name of the Lord:
The maker of heaven and earth.
Restoring of Things Profaned
Celebrant
People
The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
Celebrant
Let us pray. (Silence)
Almighty God, by the radiance of your Son’s appearing you
have purified a world corrupted by sin: We humbly pray that
you would continue to be our strong defense against the
attacks of our enemies; and grant that [this ____________
and] whatsoever in this church has been stained or defiled
through the craft of Satan or by human malice, may be
purified and cleansed by your abiding grace; that this place,
purged from all pollution, may be restored and sanctified, to
the glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now
and for ever. Amen.
Restoring of Things Profaned
Secularizing a
Consecrated Building
The Altar(s) and all consecrated and dedicated objects that are to be
preserved are removed from the building before the service begins.
The bishop, or a minister appointed by the bishop, presides.
The clergy of the congregation, the churchwardens, and other persons
who desire to participate, assemble in the building.
The Presiding Minister, using these or similar words, says
We who are gathered here know that this building, which
has been consecrated and set apart for the ministry of God’s
holy Word and Sacraments, will no longer be used in this
way, but will be taken down (used for other purposes).
To many of you this building has been hallowed by cherished
memories, and we know that some will suffer a sense of loss.
We pray that they will be comforted by the knowledge that
the presence of God is not tied to any place or building.
The Altar has been removed and protected from desecration.
It is the intention of the diocese that the congregation which
worshiped here will not be deprived of the ministry of Word
and Sacrament.
Let the [bishop’s] Declaration of Secularization now be read.
Secularizing a Consecrated Building
Then a Warden, or other person appointed, reads the bishop’s
Declaration, which is to be in the following form
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. Amen.
On the __________ day of __________, in the year of our
Lord __________, by N.N., Bishop of __________, this
building was duly dedicated and consecrated in honor of
__________ [and named __________].
The Sentence of Consecration has been in effect until this
present date.
I, N.N., Bishop of __________, do hereby revoke the said
Sentence [issued by my predecessor], and do remit this
building, and all objects remaining in it, for any lawful and
reputable use, according to the laws of this land.
This building, having now been declared deconsecrated and
secularized, I declare to be no longer subject to my canonical
jurisdiction.
This Declaration, which is to be publicly proclaimed before
witnesses gathered at the said building, is given under my
hand and seal, in the City of __________, State of
__________, and Diocese of __________, on this __________
day of __________, in the year of our Lord __________.

Then the Presiding Minister says
Lord God, in your great goodness you once accepted to your
honor and glory this building, now secularized: Receive our
praise and thanksgiving for the blessings, help, and comfort
which you bestowed upon your people in this place.
Continue, we pray, your many mercies in your Church, that
we may be conscious at all times of your unchanging love;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our prayers, and
dispose the way of your servants towards the attainment of
everlasting salvation; that among the swift and varied
changes of this world, our hearts may surely there be fixed
where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.
The Lord bless us and keep us. Amen.
The Lord make his face to shine upon us,
and be gracious to us. Amen.
The Lord lift up his countenance upon us,
and give us peace. Amen.
The Peace may be exchanged.

Concerning the Rite
The Book of Common Prayer affirms the place of the Holy Eucharist as
“the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord’s Day and other
major Feasts,” and thus the foundation of the corporate prayer of the
Church. As an act of the whole community of faith, the Eucharist is a
summons to all the baptized to share in the table of the Lord. This form
for the distribution of Holy Communion by licensed lay persons is
intended to foster a corporate sense of the Eucharist among those who,
by reason of illness or infirmity, are unable to be present in their church’s
assembly on Sunday or some other principal feast.
This service is to be conducted by a duly licensed person immediately
following such parish celebrations of the Holy Eucharist. The General
Convention (1985) has specified that “The Lay Eucharistic
Minister shall be limited to the following:
a). Administering the Elements at any Celebration of Holy Eucharist if there
is an insufficient number of Priests or Deacons present;
b). Directly following a Celebration of the Holy Eucharist on Sunday or
other principle Celebrations, if so authorized by the Member of the
Clergy in charge of the Congregation and especially licensed thereto by
the Bishop, taking the Sacrament consecrated at the Celebration to those
members of the congregation who, by reason of illness or infirmity, were
unable to be present at the Celebration.”
It is desirable that other parishioners, relatives, and friends also be
present to communicate with the person visited. Those so ministered to
should also be visited regularly by the clergy of the congregation. In this
way, those who are unable to participate regularly in the worship of the
eucharistic assembly may nevertheless experience their relation to the
community and also join their personal faith and witness to that of their
community. It is appropriate that the person be invited to join in
commenting on the Scripture and in offering suitable prayers during
the rite.

Lay Eucharistic Ministers
specially licensed to take the Sacrament
to those who are ill or infirm.
Suggested Guidelines
1. Lay Eucharistic Ministers must be adult confirmed communicants in
good standing, be carefully chosen and trained, and be specially licensed.
a candidate is to be recommneded by the cleric in charge of the
congregation to the Bishop of the diocese to be licensed. “Such special
license shall be given only at the request, and upon the recommendation,
of, the Member of the Clergy in charge of the Congregation in which the
Lay Eucharistic Minister will be serving. The license shall be issued for a
period of time not to exceed three years and shall be revocable at any
time by the Bishop, or by the Member of the clergy at whose request it
was granted.” (Title III, Canon 3, Sec. 2)
2. Where a Deacon serves in a congregation, that minister should
supervise the work of the Lay Eucharistic Ministers.
3. It is recommended that the person to be ministered to be prayed for
specifically in the Prayers of the People by the congregation on that day.
4. The administration of the Sacrament to the persons visited should
take place immediately after the service in the church. Following the
communion of the people, the Lay Eucharistic Ministers come forward
and are commended for this ministry with the following or similar
words:
In the name of this congregation, I send you forth bearing
these holy gifts, that those to whom you go may share with
us in the communion of Christ’s body and blood. We who are
many are one body, because we all share one bread, one cup.
5. A suitable container in which to carry the two vessels for the bread
and wine, corporals, and purificators is to be supplied. The container is

to be returned immediately to the parish along with any unconsumed
elements.

be notified in advance and the time of the appointment clearly set.
7. Only the order of the rite entitled“Distribution of Holy Communion

Distribution of Holy Communion
Guidelines for Use on
the Occasion of a Retirement
or Work Transition
1. The celebration may occur within the context of a Sunday or
weekday service. If it occurs during a principal service on Sunday, the
proper readings for that Sunday are to be used. Readings for other days
may be chosen from Various Occasions 10, 11, 15, 22, 23, 25 (BCP
928-931).
2. Celebrations of a spouse’s retirement or career change should uphold
the importance of the transition for both partners.
3. The person(s) might be invited by the member of the clergy in charge
to serve a special function in the liturgy (such as lector, homilist,
eucharistic minister) as appropriate. They should present the bread
and wine or receive a special blessing and prayers. Family members or
friends might read the Prayers of the People, which could be adapted to
the occasion.
4. The rite, whether focused on lay or clerical retirement, has a primary
emphasis of baptismal ministry. In constructing the rite, symbols, songs
and texts should reflect the person or couple’s understanding of their
vocation/ministry as the work God has given them to do.
Collect for Work Transitions or Retirement
Gracious God, we thank you for the work and witness of
your servant(s) N. (and N.) who has (have) enriched this
community and brought gladness to friends (and family);
now bless and preserve him at this time of transition. Guide

him in the continued use of your gifts. Give him sustenance
for temporal and spiritual needs, friends to cheer his
way, and a clear vision of the ministry to which you are
now calling him. By your Holy Spirit be present in his
pilgrimage, that he may travel with the One who is the Way,
the Truth, and the Life, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Consecration of Chrism
Apart from Baptism
Provision is made in the rite of Holy Baptism for the consecration of
Chrism in local congregations for use by a priest at baptisms in that
church which take place on subsequent occasions in the year.
The following form is intended for use when, because of the absence of
candidates for Baptism, the consecration of Chrism takes place at the
time of Confirmation (see the last rubric on page 419 of the Prayer
Book), or at some other time. The rite takes place immediately after the
postcommunion prayer, and before the bishop’s blessing and the
dismissal.
The olive oil to be consecrated should be prepared in an ampulla or
other vessel large enough to be seen clearly by the congregation.
Traditionally, a small amount of oil of balsam or other fragrant oil is
added to it, either before the service, or just before the consecratory
prayer.
If desired, the vessel of oil may be brought forward in the offertory
procession, received by a deacon or other minister, and then placed on a
convenient side table until needed.
Immediately after the postcommunion prayer, the ampulla is brought to
the bishop, who places it on a small table in the sight of the
congregation, or on the altar (the communion vessels having already
been removed).
Consecration of Chrism
Facing the people, the Bishop addresses them in these or similar words
Dear Friends in Christ: In the beginning, the Spirit of God
hovered over the creation; and, throughout history, God, by
the gift of the Holy Spirit, has empowered his people to serve
him. As a sign of that gift, the priests and kings of Israel
were anointed with oil; and our Lord Jesus was himself
anointed with the Holy Spirit at his Baptism as the Christ,
God’s own Messiah. At Baptism, Christians are likewise
anointed by that same Spirit to empower them for God’s
service. Let us now set apart this oil to be the sign of that
anointing.
Let us pray. (Silence)
The Bishop then places a hand on the vessel of oil and prays
Eternal Father, whose blessed Son was anointed by the Holy
Spirit to be the Savior and servant of all, we pray you to
consecrate this oil, that those who are sealed with it may
share in the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ; who lives and
reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.
The Liturgy then concludes in the usual way with the Bishop’s blessing
and the dismissal.
Consecration of Chrism
A Proper for the Consecration of Chrism
If there is a need to consecrate Chrism at a separate, diocesan, service
the following Proper may be used:
Collect
Almighty God, who by the power of the Holy Spirit
anointed your Son to be Messiah and Priest for ever, grant
that all whom you have called to his service may confess the
faith of Christ crucified, proclaim his resurrection, and share
in his eternal priesthood; who lives and reigns with you in
the unity of the same Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
Amen.
Old Testament Isaiah 61:1 -8
Psalm 23, or 89:20-29
Epistle Revelation 1:4-8
Gospel Luke 4:16-21
The Chrism is consecrated as described on page 234.
Consecration of Chrism
Reaffirmation
of Ordination Vows
This form is intended for use at a celebration of the Eucharist upon an
occasion when the clergy are gathered together with the bishop.
It may also be used on the occasion of the reception of a priest from
another Communion or of a restoration to the ministry.
If the Renewal of Ordination Vows takes place on Maundy Thursday, it
should be done at a celebration of the Eucharist other than the Proper
Liturgy of the day.
The following Collect may be used
Almighty God, giver of all good gifts, in your divine
providence you have appointed various orders of ministers
in your Church: Give your grace, we humbly pray, to all
who are called to any office and ministry for your people;
and so fill them with the truth of your doctrine, and clothe
them with holiness of life, that they may faithfully serve
before you, to the glory of your great Name and for the
benefit of your holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.
The Psalm and Lessons may be those appointed for Ordination, or those
for the Celebration of a New Ministry.
Ordination Vows
After the Sermon (and Creed), the Bishop sits in a chair before the Altar
and addresses those who are to renew their vows. They stand facing the
Bishop, who says these or similar words
Dear friends, the ministry we share is none other than the
sacrificial ministry of Christ, who gave himself up to death
on the cross for the salvation of the world. By his glorious
resurrection he has opened for us the way of everlasting life.
By the gift of the Holy Spirit he shares with us the riches of
his grace.
We are called to proclaim his death and resurrection, to
administer the Sacraments of the New Covenant which he
sealed with his blood on the cross, and to care for his people
in the power of the Spirit.
Do you here, in the presence of Christ and his Church,
renew your commitment to your ministry, under the pastoral
direction of your bishop?
Answer
I do.
Bishop
Do you reaffirm your promise to give yourself to
prayer and study?
I do.
Answer

Do you reaffirm your promise so to minister the
Word of God and the Sacraments of the New
Covenant that the reconciling love of Christ may
be known and received?
I do.
Do you reaffirm your promise to be a faithful
servant of all those committed to your care,
patterning your life in accordance with the
teachings of Christ, so that you may be a
wholesome example to your people?
I do.
Ordination Vows
The Bishop then stands and makes this affirmation
And now, as your bishop, I, too, before God and you,
re-dedicate myself and reaffirm the promises that I made
when I was ordained. I ask your prayers.
Bishop and Clergy
May the Lord who has given us the will to do these things,
give us also the grace and power to perform them.
The Bishop then says
People
The peace of the Lord be always with you.
And with your spirit.
The Peace is then exchanged throughout the congregation.
The service continues with the Prayers of the People, or with the
Offertory.
When this form is used for the reception of a priest from another
Communion as a priest in this Church (the canonical requirements
having been fulfilled), or for a restoration to the ministry, the service may
be adapted as necessary, and the following question and answer are
inserted immediately before the bishop’s affirmation at the top of this
page.
Will you be loyal to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of
Christ as this Church has received them? And will you, in
accordance with the canons of this Church, obey your
bishop and other ministers who may have authority over
you and your work?

I am willing and ready to do so; and I solemnly declare that I
do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament to be the Word of God, and to contain all things
necessary to salvation; and I do solemnly engage to conform
to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of The Episcopal
Church.
The newly received or restored priest is greeted personally by the bishop
at the exchange of the Peace, and, having put on the vestments proper to
the order, stands at the Altar with the bishop as a concelebrant at the
Eucharist.
A newly restored deacon is greeted in the same way, and, properly
vested, prepares the bread and wine at the Offertory.
Ordination Vows
Concerning the Service
This order is provided for use when a priest in charge of a congregation
terminates a pastoral relationship. In other circumstances, appropriate
actions of this rite may be used, and necessary alterations may be made.
It is the prerogative of the bishop to be present and to act as chief
minister, or to appoint a deputy. However, the congregation and the
departing minister may take leave of each other without the presence of
the bishop or the bishop’s representative. It is suggested that this service
take place within a Eucharist, which begins in the usual way.

you; through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who lives

new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection

Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity
of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
Direct us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious
favor, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify
thy holy Name, and finally, by thy mercy, obtain everlasting
life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

thing it is amiss, reform it. Where it is right, strengthen it;
where it is in want, provide for it; where it is divided, reunite
it; for the sake of Jesus Christ thy Son our Savior. Amen.

love and obedience to you, may be united in one body by the

Ending a Pastoral Relationship
The Ending of a Pastoral Relationship
Just before the Peace, the Minister addresses the Bishop (or the Bishop’s
Deputy) and the congregation with these or similar words
On the __________ day of __________, 19___, I was inducted
by Bishop N. as rector of __________. I have, with God’s help
and to the best of my abilities, exercised this trust, accepting
its priveleges and responsibilities.
After prayer and careful consideration, it now seems to me
that I should leave this charge, and I publicly state that my
tenure as rector of __________ ends this day.
(The Minister may, if desired, briefly state his plans for the future.)
The Bishop or the Deputy says
Do you, the people of __________, recognize and accept the
conclusion of this pastoral relationship?
People
We do.
If the Bishop or Bishop’s Deputy is not present, the Minister may address
a similar question to the congregation.
Then the Minister may express thanksgiving for the time of the tenure,
with its joys and sorrows, and state hopes for the future of the
congregation.
The Minister may present to the warden(s) a letter of resignation, the
keys of the parish, the parish altar service book, the parish register, or
other symbols fitting to the occasion.
The Minister may also express his thanks to the representatives of parish
organizations and offices, and indicate that those organizations will
continue to function.
Ending a Pastoral Relationship
The Minister may then be joined by members of his family, who may
express what life with the congregation has meant to them. One or more
representatives of the congregation may briefly respond to the Minister
and family, and bid them godspeed. If it is appropriate, representatives of
diocesan and community organizations in which the Minister or
members of his family have been active may also speak.
The Bishop or the Bishop’s Deputy may then indicate what provision has
been made for the continuation of the ministries of the parish. He may
declare the name of the locum tenens, senior warden, or other person
who is to have ecclesiastical responsibility, and may request, if it seems
appropriate, other leaders in the parish to continue their leadership until
a new incumbent is installed. He may express his feelings about the
ministry now coming to its end.
The departing Minister and the congregation then say together the
following prayer
O God, you have bound us together for a time as priest and
people to work for the advancement of your kingdom in this
place: We give you humble and hearty thanks for the
ministry which we have shared in these years now past.
Silence
We thank you for your patience with us despite our blindness
and slowness of heart. We thank you for your forgiveness
and mercy in the face of our many failures.
Silence
Especially we thank you for your never-failing presence with
us through these years, and for the deeper knowledge of you
and of each other which we have attained.
Silence
We thank you for those who have been joined to this part of
Christ’s family through baptism. We thank you for opening
Ending a Pastoral Relationship
our hearts and minds again and again to your Word, and for
feeding us abundantly with the Sacrament of the Body and
Blood of your Son.
Silence
Now, we pray, be with those who leave and with us who
stay; and grant that all of us, by drawing ever nearer to you,
may always be close to each other in the communion of your
saints. All this we ask for the sake of Jesus Christ, your Son,
our Lord. Amen.
The departing Minister, or the Bishop, or the Bishop’s Deputy then says
The peace of the Lord be always with you
People
And with your spirit.
If the Eucharist is to follow, the service continues with the offertory.
Except on major feasts, the Preface may be that for Apostles and
Ordinations.
After the Communion
Almighty God, we thank you for feeding us with the holy
food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us
through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit. We thank
you for raising up among us faithful servants of your Word
and Sacraments. We thank you especially for the work of N.
among us, and the presence of his family here. Grant that
both he and we may serve you in the days ahead, and always
rejoice in your glory, and come at length into your heavenly
kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
This blessing may be pronounced either by the minister, or by the bishop,
or by the Bishop’s Deputy.
Ending a Pastoral Relationship
May God, who has led us in the paths of justice and truth,
lead us still, and keep us in his ways. Amen.
May God, whose Son has loved us and given himself for us,
love us still, and establish us in peace. Amen.
May God, whose Spirit unites us and fills our hearts with joy,
illumine us still, and strengthen us for the years to come.
Amen.
And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, be upon you and remain with you for ever.
Amen.
If the departing Minister is the Celebrant, one of the post-communion
prayers from the Book of Common Prayer, Holy Eucharist, Rite Two,
pages 365-366, will be more appropriate.
Ending a Pastoral Relationship
Concerning the Service
This rite is designed for the recognition, investiture (and seating) of a
bishop who has previously been ordained and consecrated in and for
another diocese. It may be adapted to the circumstances of a former
suffragan bishop who has been elected as diocesan bishop, or for a
former bishop coadjutor who succeeds to the see.
The Presiding Bishop of the Church, or another bishop deputized for the
occasion, presides at the rite.
The President of the Standing Committee of the Diocese serves as Warden.
Representative presbyters, deacons, and lay persons are assigned
appropriate duties in the service.
The Readings and Psalm may be selected from the Proper of the Day,
from those appointed for the Ordination of a Bishop, or from those
appointed for Various Occasions.
The rubrics envisage the service taking place in the Cathedral Church. It
may, however, be held in some other suitable place, and the service may
be adapted when necessary.
One adaptation which will frequently need to be made is the omission
of the seating of the bishop in the cathedra. In this case, immediately
following the taking of the oath, the Presiding Bishop invites the people
to greet their new bishop. The people offer their acclamations and
applause, and the service continues with the exchange of the peace.
If a pastoral staff is used, it is carried by the former bishop in the
welcoming procession, and presented to the new bishop at the time
appointed. In the absence of the former bishop, it is placed on the Altar
before the service begins.
The Bible to be used at the taking of the Oath is placed on the Altar
before the beginning of the service.
If, for any reason, there is no Communion, the service concludes after
the Peace with the singing of a hymn or anthem, the Lord’s Prayer, the
bishop’s blessing, and the dismissal.
Investiture of a Diocesan
Recognition and Investiture
of a Diocesan Bishop
The Recognition
When the ministers and people have assembled in the Cathedral Church,
the principal doors having been closed, the Presiding Bishop is escorted
from the sacristy to a chair placed at the entrance to the chancel, facing
the people.
A welcoming procession is formed, and moves through the congregation
to the principal door.
The new Bishop, attended by two deacons, standing outside the door,
knocks upon it three times.
The Warden opens the door. As the door is opened, the Bishop’s voice is
heard, saying
Open for me the gates of righteousness; I will enter them and
give thanks to the Lord.
Warden
The Lord prosper you;
we wish you well in the Name of the Lord.
A psalm or anthem is sung, during which the bishop is escorted by the
welcoming procession to a place before the Presiding Bishop. Psalm 23
is appropriate, with the following antiphon
Investiture of a Diocesan
I will give you a shepherd after my own heart, who will feed
you with knowledge and understanding.
The new Bishop petitions as follows
I, N.N., whom God has ordained to be a shepherd and
servant, and who now have been chosen as Bishop of this
Diocese, come to you, desiring to be recognized, and
invested, [and seated in the chair which is the symbol of that
office].
The Presiding Bishop replies
Before I can accede to your petition, we must be assured by
the appointed representative of the Diocese that you will be
received as their duly elected Bishop.
The Warden then says
We are ready and willing to do so. As President of the
Standing Committee, I certify that N.N. was duly elected
Bishop of the Diocese of __________ by the clergy and
people in Diocesan Convention assembled on the
__________ day of__________, __________, and
that consents to the election have been received from (a
majority of the Bishops of the Church having jurisdiction
and of the Standing Committees of the Dioceses) (the two
houses of the General Convention). We therefore present to
you the Right Reverend N.N. to be invested for the exercise
of the office to which he has been chosen.
The Presiding Bishop then says
Let the will of the people here present be made known. Do
you recognize and receive N. as your Bishop?
People
We do.
Investiture of a Diocesan
Presiding Bishop
Will you uphold N. in this ministry?
People
We will.
The Presiding Bishop stands and calls the people to prayer, in these or
similar words
Let us now offer our prayers for N., for this Diocese, and for
all God’s people.
All kneel, and the Person appointed leads the Litany for Ordinations, or
some other approved litany. At the end of the litany, after the Kyries
(which may be sung by the congregation or choir in threefold, sixfold, or
ninefold form), the Presiding Bishop stands and says
People
The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
Presiding Bishop
Let us pray.
The Presiding Bishop then says the Collect of the Day or the Collect for
Ordination.
All sit, and the Liturgy of the Word continues in the usual manner.
After the Sermon (and Creed), the following renewal of the
commitments of ordination may take place.
The Presiding Bishop addresses the new Bishop in these or similar words
My brother, it has pleased God to call you to be the
shepherd and chief pastor of this Diocese. I am sure that
long before now you have laid to heart the high trust and
weighty obligations of this office. But, in order that this
congregation may know your commitment to fulfill this
trust, I call upon you to reaffirm the promises you made
when you were ordained and consecrated a bishop.

Concerning the Service
This service is intended for use when a new bishop has not been seated in
the cathedra of the diocese at the time of ordination or at the time of
recognition and investiture.
Normally, it will take place on the occasion of the first visit of the bishop
to the Cathedral.
On a Sunday or other major Holy Day the Proper is that of the Day. On
other days it may be one of those appointed for Various Occasions.
If, however, the seating takes place shortly after the service of ordination
or investure held on the same day in a place other than the Cathedral,
only the opening ceremonies of this service are used, concluding after the
Te Deum or Gloria in excelsis with the Lord’s Prayer, the bishop’s blessing, and the dismissal.

Setting Apart
for a Special Vocation
Individual Christians, in response to God’s call, may wish to commit
themselves to the religious life under vows made directly to the bishop of
the diocese.
The order which follows is not intended to supplant forms in use for
admitting members to religious communities.
Where life profession is intended, the process normally involves three
stages: novitiate, temporary or annual vows, and life profession. In some
instances, persons may choose not to proceed beyond the stage of annual
vows.
The novitiate is a period of testing. Admission to the novitiate normally
takes place at a weekday Daily Office, at the time of the hymn or anthem
which follows the Collects. It involves a promise to accept and follow a
specific and agreed-upon rule of life for a period of time prescribed by
the bishop.
Temporary or annual vows are made at the satisfactory conclusion of the
prescribed period of testing. At this time, the person takes vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience to the bishop, for a prescribed length of
time. This stage involves the acceptance of the obligation to recite an
approved form of the Daily Office. The rite takes place at a celebration
of the Holy Eucharist, immediately after the Prayers of the People and
before the Peace. Appropriate clothing may be presented as a sign of
dedication.
Special Vocation
Final or life vows are made at a festal celebration of the Holy Eucharist.
At this time additional symbols of dedication may be given.
The order of the rite is identical for all three stages.
1. A request by the person to be admitted to the appropriate stage.
2. A sermon or homily, or an address to the person.
3. An examination by the bishop concerning the nature of the
commitment and of the person’s desire for this special vocation.
4. The promises or vows appropriate to the stage of profession.
5. The appropriate prayer or blessing appended to this order, or some
other similar form.
6. The presentation of clothing and other symbols of special vocation.

undertaking to embrace the three-fold path of poverty,
chastity, and obedience. Grant him the strength of your
grace to persevere in his endeavor, and the guidance of the
Spirit to find his true vocation. If it be your will that he
continue in this way, reveal this to him, we pray, and bring
him in due time to the taking of solemn vows; through Jesus
Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.

May God the Lord, who called Abraham to leave home and
kindred to journey to an unknown destination, and who led
the people of Israel by the hand of Moses his servant
through the desert to the promised land: Shepherd you in
your pilgrimage, and lead you by safe pathways, for his
Name’s sake. Amen.
Special Vocation
May God the Son, who, in his earthly life, was often solitary
but never alone, because the Father was with him: Be your
constant companion in your withdrawals from the busyness
of the world, and support and strengthen you when you
return refreshed to bear witness to the love and power of
God. Amen.
May God the Holy Spirit, who helps us in our weakness, and
intercedes for the saints in accordance with the Father’s will:
Teach you to pray as you ought to pray; strengthen you in
purity of faith, in holiness of life, and in perfectness of love;
and bind you ever more and more closely to the Father
through the Son. Amen.
And may Almighty God, the holy and undivided Trinity,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, guard your body, save your
soul, and bring you safely to the heavenly country; where he
lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
Dedication of a Person Taking Life Vows
Blessed are you, O Lord our God, for your great love in
sending into the world your only-begotten Son, who for us
and for our salvation, emptied himself of his divine estate,
and embraced a life apart from the consolations of family,
having not even a place to lay his head. We bless your Name,
also, that in every age and land you have called men and
women to imitate their Lord, by setting zeal for your
kingdom and its righteousness ahead of all worldly
considerations, the love of your little ones above the claims
of flesh and blood, and obedience to your will in place of all
personal ambitions.
Special Vocation
Accept, we pray, the life profession of this your servant N.
who, following the example of the Lord Jesus, of Anna the
prophetess and holy Simeon, of the Lady Julian and
Nicholas Ferrar [of __________ ], and of countless others of
your saints, now offers himself for your service in a life of
poverty, chastity, and obedience. Bestow upon him your
Holy Spirit to dwell in him richly, to give him steadfastness
of purpose, to sanctify him more and more fully, and to
guide him surely into paths of service and of witness, to the
honor and glory of your great Name; through Jesus Christ
our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns,
one God, now and for ever. Amen.
